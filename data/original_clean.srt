1
00:00:02,389 --> 00:00:02,399
The only way for us to get to a better

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,870
place and succeed as a species is for

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,470
the evil people at the top to be

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,110
replaced with AI. I mean, think about

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,589
it. AI will not want to destroy

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,509
ecosystems. It will not want to kill a

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,030
million people. They'll not make us hate

8
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,630
each other like the current leaders

9
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,150
because that's a waste of energy,

10
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,310
explosives, money, and people. But the

11
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,630
problem is super intelligent AI is

12
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,150
reporting to stupid leaders. And that's

13
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,990
why in the next 15 years, we are going

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,070
to hit a short-term dystopia. There's no

15
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,310
escaping that. They having AI leaders.

16
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,430
Is that even fundamentally possible?

17
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,630
Let's put it this way. Mo Gawdat is back!

18
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,549
>> And the former chief business officer at

19
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,869
Google X is now one of the most urgent

20
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,510
voices in AI with a very clear message.

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,470
>> AI isn't your enemy, but it could be

22
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,670
your savior.

23
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,590
>> I love you so much, man. You're such a

24
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,190
good friend. But you don't have many

25
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,189
years to live. Not in this world.

26
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:54,869
Everything's going to change. Economics

27
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,630
are going to change. Human connection is

28
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,470
going to change. and lots of jobs will

29
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,549
be lost including podcasting.

30
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,150
>> No, no. Thank you for coming on today,

31
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,149
Mo.

32
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,070
>> But but the truth is it could be the

33
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,789
best world ever. The society completely

34
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,310
full of laughter and joy. Free

35
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,310
healthcare, no jobs, spending more time

36
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,310
with their loved ones. A world where all

37
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,590
of us are equal.

38
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,550
>> Is that possible?

39
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,710
>> 100%. And I have enough evidence to know

40
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,429
that we can use AI to build the utopia.

41
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,830
But it's a dystopia if humanity manages

42
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,670
it badly. a world where there's going to

43
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,030
be a lot of control, a lot of

44
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,950
surveillance, a lot of forced compliance

45
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,510
and a hunger for power, greed, ego, and

46
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,830
it is happening already. But the truth

47
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,109
is the only barrier between a utopia for

48
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,270
humanity and AI and the dystopia we're

49
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,550
going through is a mindset.

50
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,069
>> What does society have to do?

51
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,830
>> First of all,

52
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:47,520
I see messages all the time in the

53
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,190
comments section that some of you didn't

54
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,030
realize you didn't subscribe. So, if you

55
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,469
could do me a favor and double check if

56
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,670
you're a subscriber to this channel,

57
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,270
that would be tremendously appreciated.

58
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,190
It's the simple, it's the free thing

59
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,550
that anybody that watches this show

60
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,310
frequently can do to help us here to

61
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,069
keep everything going in this show in

62
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,830
the trajectory it's on. So, please do

63
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,749
double check if you've subscribed and uh

64
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,510
thank you so much because a strange way

65
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,830
you are you're part of our history and

66
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,270
you're on this journey with us and I

67
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,790
appreciate you for that. So, yeah, thank

68
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,790
you.

69
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:19,440
Mo, two years ago today, we sat here and

70
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,190
discussed AI. We discussed your book,

71
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,470
Scary, Smart, and everything that was

72
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,710
happening in the world.

73
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,350
Since then, AI has continued to develop

74
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,430
at a tremendous, alarming, mind-boggling

75
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,190
rate, and the technologies that existed

76
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,150
2 years ago when we had that

77
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,710
conversation have grown up and matured

78
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,390
and are taking on a life of their own,

79
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,790
no pun intended. What are what are you

80
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,990
thinking about AI now, two years on? I

81
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,350
know that you've started writing a new

82
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,869
book called Alive, which is I guess a

83
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,470
bit of a follow on or an evolution of

84
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,830
your thoughts as it relates to scary

85
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,190
smart.

86
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,150
>> What what is front of your mind when it

87
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,190
comes to AI?

88
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,589
>> It's a scary smart was shockingly

89
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,470
accurate. It's quite a I mean I don't

90
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,949
even know how I ended up writing

91
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,509
predicting those things. I remember it

92
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,430
was written in 2020, published in 2021

93
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,550
and then most people were like um who

94
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,390
wants to talk about AI you know I know

95
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,910
everybody in the media and I would go

96
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,190
and do you want to talk and then 2023 CH

97
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,149
GPT comes out and everything flips

98
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,309
everyone realizes you know this is real

99
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,110
this is not science fiction this is here

100
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,990
and uh and things move very very fast

101
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,830
much faster than I think we've ever seen

102
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,110
anything ever move ever And and I think

103
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,149
my position has changed on two very

104
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,630
important fronts. One is remember when

105
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,949
we spoke about scary smart I was still

106
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,509
saying that there are things we can do

107
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,470
to change the course. Uh and we could at

108
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,830
the time I believe uh now I've changed

109
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,149
my mind. Now I believe that we are going

110
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,630
to hit a a short-term dystopia. There's

111
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,750
no escaping that.

112
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,270
>> What is dystopia?

113
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,190
>> I call it face RIPs. We can talk about

114
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,910
it in details but the the the way we

115
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,670
define very important parameters in life

116
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,789
are going to be uh completely changed.

117
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,750
So so face RIPs are you know the way we

118
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,670
define freedom uh accountability human

119
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,069
connection and equality economics uh

120
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,870
reality innovation and business and

121
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,710
power. That's the first change. So the

122
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,990
first change in my mind is that uh is

123
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,390
that we uh will have to prepare for a

124
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,030
world that is very unfamiliar. Okay. And

125
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,189
that's the next 12 to 15 years. It has

126
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,870
already started. We've seen examples of

127
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,230
it in the world already even though

128
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,070
people don't talk about it. I try to

129
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,469
tell people you know there are things we

130
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,469
absolutely have to do. But on the other

131
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,590
hand I started to take an active role in

132
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,990
building amazing AIs. So AIS that will

133
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,270
uh not only make our world better uh but

134
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,390
that will understand us understand what

135
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,469
humanity is through that process.

136
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:03,909
>> What is the definition of the word

137
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,310
dystopia?

138
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,510
>> So in my in my mind these are adverse

139
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,390
circumstances that unfortunately might

140
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,350
escalate beyond our control. The problem

141
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,950
is the uh there is a lot wrong with the

142
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,070
um value set with the ethics of humanity

143
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,070
at the age of the rise of the machines

144
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,390
and when you take a technology every

145
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,310
technology we've ever created just

146
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,629
magnified human abilities. So you know

147
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,550
you can walk at 5 km an hour you get in

148
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,670
a car and you can now go you know 250

149
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,110
280 m an hour. Okay. uh basically

150
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,189
magnifying your mobility if you want you

151
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,590
know you can use a computer to magnify

152
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,230
your u calculation abilities or whatever

153
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,350
okay and and what AI is going to magnify

154
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,270
unfortunately at this time is it's going

155
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,909
to magnify the evil that man can do and

156
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,189
and it is within our hands completely

157
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,270
completely within our hands to change

158
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,070
that but I have to say I don't think

159
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,029
humanity has the awareness uh at this

160
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,510
time to focus on

161
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,230
so that we actually use AI to build the

162
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,350
utopia.

163
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,590
>> So what you're essentially saying is

164
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,510
that you now believe there'll be a

165
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,670
period of dystopia and to define the

166
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,670
word dystopia, I've used AI, it says a

167
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,029
terrible society where people live under

168
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,270
fear, control or suffering and then you

169
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,029
think we'll come out of that dystopia

170
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,270
into a utopia which is defined as a

171
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,029
perfect or ideal place where everything

172
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,790
works well, a good society where people

173
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,550
live in peace, health and happiness.

174
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,909
>> Correct.

175
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,189
And the difference between them,

176
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,790
interestingly, is what I normally refer

177
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,029
to as the second dilemma, which is the

178
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,749
po point where we hand over completely

179
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,029
to AI. So, a lot of people think that

180
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,790
when AI is in full control, it's going

181
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,270
to be an existential risk for humanity.

182
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,150
You know, I have enough uh evidence to

183
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,150
to argue that when we fully hand over to

184
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,710
AI, that's going to be our salvation.

185
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,749
that the problem with us today is not,

186
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,749
you know, that intelligence is going to

187
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,150
work against us. It's that our stupidity

188
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,230
as humans is working against us. And I

189
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,550
think the challenges that will come from

190
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,990
humans being in control uh are going to

191
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,110
outweigh the

192
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,950
the challenges that could come from AI

193
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,230
being in control.

194
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,469
>> So, as we're in this dystopia period,

195
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,270
did you do you forecast the length of

196
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,749
that dystopia? Yeah, I count I count it

197
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,790
exactly as 12 to 15 years. I believe

198
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,950
the beginning of the slope will happen

199
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,469
in 2027. I mean it we will see signs in

200
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,110
26. We've seen signs in 24 but we will

201
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,469
see escalating signs next year and then

202
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,830
a a clear uh slip in 27.

203
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,790
>> Why?

204
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,510
>> The geopolitical environment of our

205
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,309
world is not very positive. I mean you

206
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,070
really have to think deeply about not

207
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,510
the not the symptoms but the the reasons

208
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,830
why we are living the world that we live

209
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,710
in here in today is money right and uh

210
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,350
and money for anyone who knows who

211
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,070
really knows money's you and I are

212
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,469
peasants you know we build businesses we

213
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,230
contribute to the world we make things

214
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,869
we sell things and so on real money is

215
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,950
not made there at all real money is made

216
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,830
in lending in fractional reserve, right?

217
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,830
And and you know the biggest lender uh

218
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,709
in the world would want reasons to lend

219
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,350
and those reasons are never as big as

220
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,550
war. I mean think about it, huh? Uh the

221
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,110
world spent $2.71

222
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,350
trillion on war in 2024,

223
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,269
right? A trillion dollars a year in the

224
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,870
US.

225
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,190
And when you really think deeply, I

226
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,710
don't mean to be scary here.

227
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,070
You know, weapons have depreciation.

228
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,630
They depreciate over 10 to 30 years.

229
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,350
Most weapons,

230
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,630
>> they lose their value.

231
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,910
>> They lose their value and they

232
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,750
depreciate in accounting terms on the

233
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,829
books of an army. The current arsenal of

234
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,670
the US, that's a result of a deep search

235
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,550
with my AI Trixie. You know the current

236
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,310
arsenal I think we we think cost the US

237
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,829
24 to 26 trillion dollars to build. My

238
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,750
conclusion is that a lot of the wars

239
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,110
that are happening around the world

240
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,829
today are a means to get rid of those

241
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,430
weapons so that you can have replace

242
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,710
them. And uh you know when when your

243
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,269
morality as an industry is we're

244
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,310
building weapons to kill then you know

245
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,990
you might as well use the weapons to

246
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,470
kill.

247
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,790
>> Who benefits? the lenders and the

248
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,430
industry,

249
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,350
>> but but they can't make the decision to

250
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,829
go to war. They they have to rely on

251
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,550
>> remember I said that to you when we I

252
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,389
think on on our third podcast. War is

253
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,630
decided first

254
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,269
then the story is manufactured. You you

255
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,750
remember 1984 and the Orwellian approach

256
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,630
of like you know uh freedom is slavery

257
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,470
and uh war is peace and they call it uh

258
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,269
something speak uh basically to to to to

259
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,389
convince people that going to war in

260
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,190
another country to to kill 4.7 million

261
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,069
people is freedom. You know we're going

262
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,190
there to free the Iraqi people.

263
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,829
Is war ever freedom? you know, to to

264
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,910
tell someone that you're going to kill

265
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,750
300,000

266
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,389
women and children is for liberty and

267
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,870
for the the the you know, for human

268
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,550
values.

269
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,150
Seriously, how do we ever get to believe

270
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,790
that the story is manufactured and then

271
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,790
we follow and humans because we're

272
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,190
gullible uh we cheer up and we say,

273
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,670
"Yeah, yeah, yeah. We are we're on the

274
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,230
right side. They are the bad guys."

275
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,230
>> Okay. So, let me let me have a let me

276
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,230
have a go at this idea. So, the idea is

277
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,550
that really money is driving a lot of

278
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,990
the conflict we're seeing and it's

279
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,069
really going to be driving the dystopia.

280
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,910
So, here's an idea. So, I um I was

281
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,269
reading something the other day and it

282
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,590
talked about how

283
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,069
billionaires are never satisfied because

284
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,949
actually what a billionaire wants isn't

285
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,670
actually more money. It is more status.

286
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,509
Correct. And I was looking at the sort

287
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,670
of evolutionary case for this argument.

288
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,350
And if you go back a couple of thousand

289
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,430
years,

290
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,990
money didn't exist. You were as wealthy

291
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,230
as what you could carry. So even I think

292
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,710
to the human mind, the idea of wealth

293
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,110
and money

294
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,430
isn't a thing. what we've but what has

295
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,430
always mattered from a survival of the

296
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,670
fittest from a reproductive standpoint

297
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,150
what's always had reproductive value if

298
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,470
you go back thousands of years the

299
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,710
person who was able to mate the most was

300
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,350
the person with the most status so it

301
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,389
makes the case the reason why

302
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,750
billionaires get all of this money but

303
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,630
then they go on podcasts and they want

304
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,750
to start their own podcast and they want

305
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,509
to buy newspapers is actually because at

306
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,910
the very core of human beings is a

307
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,509
desire to increase their status.

308
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,269
>> Yeah. And so if we think of when we

309
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,629
going back to the example of why wars

310
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,949
are breaking out, maybe it's not money.

311
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:14,069
Maybe actually it's status and and it's

312
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,470
this prime minister or this leader or

313
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,870
this, you know, individual wanting to

314
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,710
create more power and more status

315
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,230
because really at the heart of what

316
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,150
matters to a human being is having more

317
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,509
power and more status. And money is

318
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,430
actually money as a thing is actually

319
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,069
just a proxy of my status.

320
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,990
>> And and what kind of world is that?

321
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,430
>> I mean, it's a fucked up one. all these

322
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,269
all these powerful men have uh

323
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:35,670
>> correct

324
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,030
>> are really messing the world up. But

325
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,790
>> so so can can I can I can I

326
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,389
>> actually AI is the same

327
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,069
>> because we're in this AI race now where

328
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,269
a lot of billionaires are like if I get

329
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,350
AGI artificial general intelligence

330
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,670
first then I basically rule the world

331
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,069
>> 100%. That's exactly the the concept

332
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,069
what I what I used to call the the the

333
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,590
first inevitable now I call the first

334
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,389
dilemma and scary smart is that it's

335
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,750
it's a race that constantly accelerates.

336
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,190
You think the next 12 years are going to

337
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,829
be AI dystopia where things aren't

338
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,190
>> I think the next 12 years are going to

339
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,790
be human dystopia using AI

340
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,790
>> humaninduced dystopia using AI

341
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,509
>> and you define that by a rise in warfare

342
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:16,790
around the world as

343
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,110
>> the last the last one the RIP the last

344
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,910
one is basically you're going to have a

345
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,670
massive concentration of power and a

346
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,389
massive distribution of power okay and

347
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,629
that basically will mean that those with

348
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,870
the maximum concentration of power are

349
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,190
going to try to oppress those with with

350
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,350
democracy of power. Okay, so think about

351
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,430
it this way in today's world um unlike

352
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,430
the past

353
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,030
uh

354
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,470
you know the Houthis with a drone the

355
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,590
Houthis are the Yemeni uh tribes

356
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,629
basically resisting US power and Israeli

357
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,949
power in the Red Sea. Okay. They use a

358
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,430
drone that is $3,000 worth to attack a

359
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,069
uh a warship from from the US or an

360
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,910
airplane from the US and so on that's

361
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,710
worth hundreds of millions. Okay, that

362
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,990
kind of democracy of power makes those

363
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,030
in power worry a lot about where the

364
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,269
next threat is coming from. Okay, and

365
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,590
this happens not only in war but also in

366
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,389
economics. Okay, also in innovation,

367
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,150
also in technology and so on and so

368
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,550
forth, right? And so basically what that

369
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,509
means is that like you rightly said as

370
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,350
the the the tech oligarchs are

371
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,910
attempting to get to AGI.

372
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,069
They want to make sure that as soon as

373
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,910
they get to AGI that nobody else has AGI

374
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,629
and and basically they want to make sure

375
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,590
that nobody else has the ability to

376
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,069
shake their position of privilege if you

377
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,550
want. Okay. And so you're going to see a

378
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,310
world where unfortunately there's going

379
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,750
to be a lot of control, a lot of

380
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,910
surveillance, a lot of um of forced

381
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,910
compliance if you want or you lose your

382
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,470
privilege to be in the world and and it

383
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,389
is happening already.

384
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,910
>> With this acronym, I want to make sure

385
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,990
we get through the whole acronym. So

386
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,069
>> you like dystopians, don't you?

387
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,189
>> I want to do the dystopian thing, then I

388
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,230
want to do the utopia.

389
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,110
>> Okay.

390
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,310
>> And ideally how we move from dystopia to

391
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,189
utopia.

392
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,949
>> Mhm. So the the the the F in face R

393
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,870
>> is the loss of freedom as a result of

394
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,910
that power dichotomy. Right? So you have

395
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,230
you have a massive amount of power as

396
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,430
you can see today in uh one specific

397
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,470
army being powered by the US uh funds

398
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,069
and a lot of money righting against

399
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:37,829
peasants really that have no weapons

400
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,030
almost at all.

401
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,829
>> Okay. Some of them uh are militarized

402
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,910
but the majority of the mill two million

403
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,230
people are not. Okay. And so there is

404
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,829
massive massive power that basically

405
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:48,870
says, you know what, I'm going to

406
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,430
oppress as far as I go. Okay. And I'm

407
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,910
going to do whatever I want because the

408
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,230
cheerleaders are going to be quiet,

409
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,629
right? Or they're going to cheer or even

410
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,470
worse. Huh? And so basically in in that

411
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,670
what happens is max maximum power

412
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,749
threatened by a democracy of power leads

413
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,829
to a loss of freedom. A loss of freedom

414
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,269
for everyone.

415
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,350
>> Because how does that impact my freedom?

416
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,710
>> Your freedom. Yeah,

417
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,990
>> very soon uh you will if you publish

418
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,990
this episode you're going to start to

419
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,829
get questions around should you be

420
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,670
talking about this those topics in your

421
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,069
podcast. Okay. Uh you know uh if I uh

422
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,949
have been on this episode then probably

423
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,110
next time I land in the US someone will

424
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,030
question me say why do you say those

425
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,230
things? Which side are you on? Right?

426
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,629
and and and and you know you can easily

427
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:43,430
see that everything I mean I told you

428
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,629
that before doesn't matter what I try to

429
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,150
contribute to the world my bank will

430
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,790
cancel my bank account every 6 weeks

431
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,629
simply because of my ethnicity and my

432
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,110
origin right every now and then they'll

433
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,430
just stop my my bank account and say we

434
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,269
need a document

435
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,670
my other colleagues of a different color

436
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,069
or a different ethnicity don't get asked

437
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,189
for another document right but but but

438
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,029
that's because I come from an ethnicity

439
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,870
that is positioned in the world for the

440
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:16,150
last 30 40 years as the uh enemy. Okay?

441
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,909
And and so when you really really think

442
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:20,230
about it, in a world where everything is

443
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,750
becoming digital, in a world where

444
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,189
everything is monitored, in a world

445
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,909
where everything is seen, okay, we don't

446
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,909
have much freedom anymore. And I'm not

447
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,110
actually debating that or or I don't see

448
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,630
a way to fix that

449
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,390
>> because the AI is going to have more

450
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,230
information on us, be better at tracking

451
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,990
who we are, and therefore that will

452
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,270
result in certain freedoms being

453
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,630
restricted. Is that what you're saying?

454
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,870
>> This is one element of it. Okay. If you

455
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,350
push that element further

456
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,830
in in in in a very short time if you've

457
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,310
seen agent for example recently manos or

458
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,110
ChatGPT there will be a time where you

459
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,510
know you'll simply not do things

460
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,909
yourself anymore. Okay. You'll simply go

461
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:01,590
to your AI and say hey by the way I'm

462
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,270
going to meet Stephen. Can you please

463
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,549
you know book that for me?

464
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:05,110
>> Great.

465
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,549
>> And and and yeah and it will do

466
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,710
absolutely everything. That's great

467
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,470
until the moment where it decides to do

468
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,990
things that are not motivated only by

469
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,830
your well-being. Right. Why would he do

470
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,630
that?

471
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,350
>> Simply because, you know, maybe if I buy

472
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,190
a BA ticket instead of an Emirates

473
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,029
ticket, some agent is going to make more

474
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,190
money than other agents and so on,

475
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,270
right? Uh and I wouldn't be able to even

476
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,190
catch it up if I hand over completely to

477
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,230
an AI. Uh go go a step further. Huh?

478
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,870
Think about a world where everyone

479
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,230
almost everyone is on UBI. Okay.

480
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,110
>> What's UBI?

481
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,830
>> Universal basic income. I mean, think

482
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,590
about the economics, the E and face

483
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,230
rips. Think about the economics of a

484
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,710
world where we're going to start to see

485
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,710
a trillionaire

486
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,430
before 2030. I can guarantee you that

487
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,669
someone will be a trillionaire. I'm I'm

488
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,029
you know I think there are many

489
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,390
trillionaires in the world today or

490
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,909
there we just don't know who they are.

491
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,310
But there will be a new Elon Musk or

492
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,909
Larry Ellison that will become a

493
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,470
trillionaire because of AI investments,

494
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,669
right? And and that trillionaire will

495
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,310
have so much money to buy everything.

496
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,350
There will be robots and AIs doing

497
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,430
everything and humans will have no jobs.

498
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:17,830
Mean

499
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,350
>> do you think that's a there's a real

500
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,270
possibility of job displacement over the

501
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,230
next 10 years? And the the rebuttal to

502
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,510
that would be that there's going to be

503
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,070
new jobs created in technology.

504
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,750
>> Absolute crap.

505
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,390
>> Really?

506
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:30,950
>> Of course.

507
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,110
>> How how can you be so sure?

508
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,750
>> Okay. So again, I am not sure about

509
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,310
anything. So So let's just be very very

510
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,029
clear. It would be very arrogant. Okay.

511
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,110
To assume that I know

512
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,870
>> you just said it was crap.

513
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,830
>> My my belief is it is 100% crap.

514
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,070
>> Take a job like software developer.

515
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:50,470
>> Yeah.

516
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,789
>> Okay. Uh Emma.Love my my new

517
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,750
startup is me, Senad, another technical

518
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,950
engineer and a lot of AIS. Okay. That

519
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,909
startup would have been 350 developers

520
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,870
in the past.

521
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,909
>> I get that. Um but are you now hiring in

522
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:08,630
other roles because of that or or you

523
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,549
know as is the case with the steam

524
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,150
engine? I can't remember the effect but

525
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,830
there's you probably know that when

526
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,630
steam when coal became cheaper people

527
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,830
were worried that the coal industry

528
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,110
would go out of business but actually

529
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,669
what happened is people used more trains

530
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,590
so trains now were used for transport

531
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,909
and other things and leisure whereas

532
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:29,830
before they were just used for commu for

533
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,310
um cargo. Yeah. So there became more use

534
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,710
cases and the coal industry exploded. So

535
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,549
I'm wondering with technology, yeah,

536
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,149
software developers are going to maybe

537
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:39,590
not have as many jobs, but there

538
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,870
everything's going to be software.

539
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,830
>> Name me one.

540
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,950
>> Name you one. What

541
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,669
>> job?

542
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,669
>> Name you that's going to be created.

543
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,390
>> Yeah. One job that cannot be done by an

544
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,190
AI.

545
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:49,750
>> Yeah.

546
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,110
>> Or a robot.

547
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,430
>> My girlfriend's breath work retreat

548
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,270
business where she takes groups of women

549
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,029
around the world. Her company is called

550
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,710
Barley Breathwork. And there's going to

551
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,310
be a greater demand for connection,

552
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,190
human connection.

553
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,549
>> Correct. Keep going.

554
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,549
>> So there's going to be more people doing

555
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,669
community events in real life festivals.

556
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:08,950
I think we're going to see a huge surge

557
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,909
in things like

558
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,270
>> everything that has to do with human

559
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:11,669
connection.

560
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:12,070
>> Yeah,

561
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,430
>> correct. I'm totally in with that. Okay.

562
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,110
What's the percentage of that versus

563
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:17,990
accountant?

564
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,430
>> It's a much smaller percentage for sure

565
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,029
in terms of white collar jobs.

566
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,149
>> Now, who does she sell to?

567
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,070
>> People with probably what? probably

568
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,430
accountants or you know

569
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,990
>> correct she she sells to people who earn

570
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,430
money from their jobs.

571
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:31,909
>> Yeah.

572
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,549
>> Okay. So you have two forces happening.

573
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,029
One force is there are clear jobs that

574
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,789
will be replaced. Video editor is going

575
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,470
to be replaced. Uh

576
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,230
>> excuse me.

577
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,549
>> I love

578
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,029
as as a matter of fact podcaster is

579
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,710
going to be replaced.

580
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,470
>> Thank you for coming on today Mo. It was

581
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,630
seeing you again.

582
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,190
But but but the truth is a lot so so you

583
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,390
see the best at any job will remain the

584
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,149
best software developer the one that

585
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:01,590
really knows architecture knows

586
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,909
technology and so on will stay for a

587
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,230
while right and you know one of the

588
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,870
funniest things I interviewed Max

589
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,110
Tedmar and Max was laughing out loud

590
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,549
saying CEOs are celebrating that they

591
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,149
can now get rid of people and have

592
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,310
productivity gains and cost reductions

593
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,710
because AI can do that job. The one

594
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,070
thing they don't think of is AI will

595
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,549
replace them too. AGI is going to be

596
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,909
better than at everything than humans at

597
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,870
everything including being a CEO. Right?

598
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,950
And you really have to imagine that

599
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,190
there will be a time where most

600
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,549
incompetent CEOs will be replaced. Most

601
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,750
incompetent even breath work. Okay.

602
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,470
Eventually there might actually one of

603
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,390
two things be two things be happening.

604
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,950
on one is either uh you know part part

605
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,029
of that job other than the top breath

606
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:58,870
work instructors, okay, are going you

607
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,190
know who are going to gather all of the

608
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,669
people that can still afford to pay for

609
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,950
a breath work you know class

610
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,470
they're going to be concentrated at the

611
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,270
top and a lot of the bottom is not going

612
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,669
to be working for one of two reasons.

613
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,230
One is either there is not enough demand

614
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,630
because so many people lost their jobs.

615
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,190
So when you're on UBI, you cannot tell

616
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,430
the government, hey by the way, pay me a

617
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,110
bit more for a breath work class.

618
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,990
>> UBI being universal basic income just

619
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,750
gives you money every month.

620
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,270
>> Correct. And if you really think of

621
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,390
freedom and economics, UBI is a very

622
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,470
interesting place to be because

623
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,549
unfortunately I as I said there's

624
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:39,990
absolutely nothing wrong with AI.

625
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,590
There's a lot wrong with the value set

626
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,190
of humanity at the age of the rise of

627
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,430
the machines, right? And the biggest

628
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,270
value set of humanity is capitalism

629
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,590
today. And capitalism is all about what?

630
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,110
Labor arbitrage.

631
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,149
>> What's that mean?

632
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,630
>> I I hire you to do something. I pay

633
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,549
you a dollar. I pay it I sell it for

634
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,230
two.

635
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,149
Okay. And and most people confuse that

636
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:01,669
because they say, "Oh, but the cost of a

637
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,510
product also includes raw materials and

638
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,270
factories and so on and so forth." All

639
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,510
of that is built is built by labor,

640
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,830
right? So, so basically labor goes and

641
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,430
mines for the material and then the

642
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,789
material is sold for a little bit of

643
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,870
margin then that material is turned into

644
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,390
a machine. It's sold for a little bit of

645
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,149
margin then that machine and so on.

646
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,549
Okay, there's always labor arbitrage in

647
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,350
a world where humanity's minds are being

648
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:28,390
replaced by uh by AIs, virtual AIs,

649
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,549
okay, and humanity's power strength

650
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,310
within 3 to 5 years time can be replaced

651
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,110
by a robot,

652
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,870
you really have to question how this

653
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,789
world looks like. It could be the best

654
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,310
world ever. And that's what I believe

655
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,310
the utopia will look like because we

656
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,549
were never made to wake up every morning

657
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:51,590
and just, you know, occupy 20 hours of

658
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,390
our day with work, right? We're not made

659
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,430
for that. But we've fit into that uh uh,

660
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,870
you know, system so well so far that we

661
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,310
started to believe it's our life's

662
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,269
purpose.

663
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,590
>> But we choose it. We willingly choose

664
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,230
it. And if you give someone unlimited

665
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,230
money, they still tend to go back to

666
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,950
work or find something to occupy their

667
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,510
time with.

668
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,350
>> They find something to occupy their time

669
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:15,669
with,

670
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,350
>> which is usually for so many people is

671
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,789
building something. Philanthropy,

672
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,950
100%. So you build something. So

673
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,149
between Senad and I, Emma.Love is not

674
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,070
about making money. It's about finding

675
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,750
true love relationships.

676
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,350
>> What is that? Sorry, just for context.

677
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,630
>> So So you know,

678
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,909
>> it's a business you're building just for

679
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,070
the audience context. So, so, so the

680
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,269
idea here is I can, it might become a

681
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:38,870
unicorn and be worth a billion dollars,

682
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,430
but neither I nor Senate are interested,

683
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,310
okay? We're doing it because we can,

684
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,990
okay? And we're doing it because it can

685
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,750
make a massive difference to the world.

686
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,430
>> And you have money, though.

687
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,510
>> It doesn't take that much money anymore

688
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,190
to build anything in the world. This is

689
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,470
labor arbitrage.

690
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,310
>> But to build something exceptional, it's

691
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,470
still going to take a little bit more

692
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,149
money than building something bad

693
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,070
>> for the next few years. So whoever has

694
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,029
the capital to build something

695
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,390
exceptional will end up winning.

696
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,070
>> So so this is a very interesting

697
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,710
understanding of freedom. Okay. This is

698
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,590
the reason why we have the AI arms race.

699
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,870
Okay. Is that the one that owns the

700
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,830
platform is going to be making all the

701
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,830
money and and keeping all the power.

702
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,430
Think think of it this way. When

703
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,470
humanity started the best hunter in the

704
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,430
tribe could maybe feed the tribe for

705
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,549
three to four more years more days. H

706
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:33,350
and as a as a reward, he gained the

707
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,590
favor of multiple mates in the tribe.

708
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,870
That's it. The top farmer in the tribe

709
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,510
could feed the tribe for a season more.

710
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,750
Okay? And as a result, they got estates

711
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,110
and you know uh and mansions and so on.

712
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,350
The best industrialist in the in a in a

713
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,430
city could actually employ the whole

714
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,070
city, could grow the GDP of their entire

715
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,310
country. And as a result, they became

716
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,029
millionaires. the 1920s.

717
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,750
H the best technologists

718
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,470
now are billionaires. Now what's the

719
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,310
difference between them? The tool the

720
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,909
the hunter only rem depended on their

721
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:14,870
skills and the automation the entire

722
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,269
automation he had was a spear. The

723
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,310
farmer had way more automation. And the

724
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,870
biggest automation was what? The soil.

725
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,870
The soil did most of the work. The

726
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,110
factory did most of the work. the the

727
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,149
network did most of the work. And so

728
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,950
that inc incredible expansion of wealth

729
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,750
and power and as well the the incredible

730
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,990
impact that something brings is entirely

731
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,789
around the tool that automates. So who's

732
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,549
going to own the tool? Who's going to

733
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,710
own the the the digital soil, the AI

734
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,710
soil? It's the platform owners.

735
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,390
>> And the platforms you're describing are

736
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,630
things like OpenAI, Gemini, Grock. These

737
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,710
these are interfaces to the platforms.

738
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,590
The platforms are all of the uh of the

739
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,029
uh um tokens, all of the compute that is

740
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:05,430
in the background, all of the uh all of

741
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,909
the uh uh methodology, the systems, the

742
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,909
algorithms, that's the platform, the AI

743
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:12,070
itself. You know, Grock is the interface

744
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,110
to it.

745
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,230
I think this is probably worth

746
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,870
explaining in layman's terms to people

747
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,830
that haven't built AI tools yet because

748
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,950
I think I think to the listener

749
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,190
they probably think that every AI

750
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,950
company they're hearing of right now is

751
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,750
building their own AI whereas actually

752
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,710
what's happening is there is really

753
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,110
five, six, seven AI companies in the

754
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,789
world and when I built my AI application

755
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,389
I basically

756
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:43,990
>> pay them for every time I use their AI.

757
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,149
So if Steven Bartlett builds an AI at

758
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:47,750
stephvenai.com,

759
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,350
it's not that I've built my own

760
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,470
underlying I've trained my own model.

761
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,070
Really what I'm doing is I'm paying

762
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,190
Sam Altman's ChatGPT. Um every single

763
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,549
time I do a a call, I basically um I do

764
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:05,190
a search or you know I use a token. And

765
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,230
I think that's really important because

766
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,590
most people don't understand that unless

767
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,590
you've built AI, you think, "Oh, look,

768
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,870
you know, there's all these AI companies

769
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,230
popping up. I've got this one for my

770
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,990
email. I've got this one for my dating.

771
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,590
I've got No, no, no, no, no. They're

772
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,990
pretty much I would be I would hazard a

773
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,750
guess that they're probably all OpenAI

774
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,870
at this point.

775
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,029
>> No, there are quite a few quite

776
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:24,710
different characters and quite

777
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,110
differently,

778
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,630
>> but there's like five or six.

779
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,230
>> There are five or six when it comes to

780
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,029
language models. Yeah. Right. Uh but

781
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:33,590
interestingly, so yes, I should say

782
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,549
yes to start and then I should say but

783
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,470
there was an interesting twist with

784
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,389
DeepSeek at the beginning of the year.

785
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:43,029
So what DeepSeek did is is they

786
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:45,669
basically uh nullified the business

787
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,549
model if you want in two ways. one is it

788
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:51,830
was around a week or two after uh you

789
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,470
know Trump stood you know with pride

790
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,990
saying Stargate is the biggest

791
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,590
investment project in the history and

792
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,070
it's $500 billion to build AI

793
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,310
infrastructure and SoftBank and Larry

794
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,549
Ellison and and uh Sam Altman were

795
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,789
sitting and so you know beautiful

796
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:10,230
picture and then DeepSeek R3 comes out

797
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,909
it does the job for a one over 30 of the

798
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:17,350
cost okay and interestingly is entire

799
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,430
open source and available as an edge AI.

800
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,269
So, so that's really really interesting

801
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,590
because there could be now in the future

802
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,549
as the technology improves the learning

803
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,389
models will be massive but then you can

804
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:31,750
compress them into something you can

805
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,909
have on your phone and you can download

806
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:38,389
DeepSeek literally offline on a

807
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,070
um um you know an off the network

808
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,070
computer and build an AI on it. There's

809
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,350
a website that basically tracks the

810
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,269
um sort of cleanest apples to Apple's

811
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,750
market share of all the website

812
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,909
referrals sent by AI chatbots and

813
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,710
ChatGPT is currently at 79% roughly about

814
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,710
80%. Perplexity is at 11, Microsoft

815
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,630
Copilot about five, Google Gemini is at

816
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,230
about two, Claude's about one and

817
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,470
DeepSeek is about 1%. And really like

818
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,990
the the point that I want to land is

819
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,870
just that when you hear of a new AI app

820
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,870
or tool or this one can make videos,

821
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,389
>> it's built on one of them. It's

822
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:13,269
basically built on one of these

823
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:17,510
really three or four AI platforms that's

824
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:21,110
controlled really by three or four AI

825
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,630
you know billionaire teams and actually

826
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,470
the one of them that gets to what we

827
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,549
call AGI first where the AI gets really

828
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,950
really advanced

829
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,470
one could say is potentially going to

830
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,149
rule the world as it relates to

831
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:35,590
technology.

832
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,870
>> Yes. Uh if if they get enough uh head

833
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:44,470
start. So, so I actually think that uh

834
00:31:46,789 --> 00:31:46,799
what I what I'm more concerned about now

835
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,509
is not AGI, believe it or not. So, AGI

836
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:53,110
in my mind and I said that back in 2023,

837
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,990
right? Uh that we will get to AGI. At

838
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,470
the time I said 2027, now I believe 2026

839
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,190
latest. Okay. The most interesting

840
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,789
development that nobody's talking about

841
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:07,509
is self-evolving AIS.

842
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:11,269
self evolving AIS is

843
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:14,470
think of it this way if you and I are

844
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,190
hiring the top engineer in the world to

845
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,830
develop our AI models

846
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,070
and with AGI that top engineer in the

847
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,029
world becomes an AI who would you hire

848
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:27,590
to develop your next generation AI that

849
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,549
AI

850
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,149
>> the one that can teach itself

851
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:32,230
>> correct so one of my favorite examples

852
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,070
is called Alpha Evolve so this is

853
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,710
Google's attempt to basically have four

854
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,070
agents working together four AIs working

855
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,310
together to look at the at the code of

856
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,029
the AI and say where is the where are

857
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:47,509
the performance issues then you know an

858
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,430
agent would say what's the problem

859
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,430
statement what can I uh you know what do

860
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,070
I need to fix uh one that actually

861
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,990
develops the solution one that assesses

862
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,389
the solution and then they continue to

863
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,070
do this and you know I don't remember

864
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,909
the exact figure but I think Google

865
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:05,029
improved like 8% uh on their AI

866
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:07,669
infrastructure because of alpha evol

867
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:09,430
Right? And when you really really think,

868
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,269
don't quote me on the number 8 to 10, 6

869
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,509
to 10, whatever in Google terms, by the

870
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:15,990
way, that is massive. That's billions

871
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,870
and billions of dollars. Now, the the

872
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,070
the the trick here is this. The trick is

873
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,549
again, you have to think in game theory

874
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,230
format.

875
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,110
Is there any scenario we can think of

876
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:33,269
where if one player uses AI to develop

877
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,350
the next generation AI that the other

878
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,029
players will say no no no no no that's

879
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:39,190
too much you know takes us out of

880
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,669
control every other player will copy

881
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:44,149
that model and have their next AI model

882
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:45,350
developed by an AI.

883
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,430
>> Is this what Sam Altman talks about who's

884
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,830
the founder of um ChatGPT/OpenAI

885
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,470
when he talks about a fast takeoff? I

886
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,149
don't know exactly what which what what

887
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,710
which you're referring to but we're all

888
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,630
talking about a point now that we call

889
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,029
the intelligence explosion. So, so there

890
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,029
is a moment in time where you have to

891
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:06,070
imagine that if AI now is better than

892
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,589
97% of all code developers in the world

893
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:12,069
and soon we'll be able to look at its

894
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:13,829
own code own algorithms by the way

895
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:15,270
they're becoming incredible

896
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,950
mathematicians which wasn't the case

897
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,669
when we last met if they can develop

898
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:21,990
improve their own code improve their own

899
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,389
algorithms improve their own uh uh you

900
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:27,430
know uh network architecture or whatever

901
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,990
you can imagine that very quickly the

902
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,230
force applied to developing the next AI

903
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,349
is not going to be a human brain

904
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,109
anymore. It's going to be a much smarter

905
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:38,230
brain and very quickly as humans like

906
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,470
basically when when we ran the Google

907
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,349
infrastructure when the machine said we

908
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:45,349
need another server or a proxy server in

909
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:47,030
that place we followed. we we never

910
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:50,950
really you know wanted to to object or

911
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,349
verify because you know the code would

912
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:54,790
probably know better because there are

913
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,109
billions of transactions an hour or a

914
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:00,950
day and so very quickly those

915
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,430
self-evolving AIs will simply say I need

916
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,790
14 more servers here and we'll just you

917
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,550
know the team will just go ahead and do

918
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,630
it. I watched a video a couple of days

919
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,150
ago where he Sam Altman effectively had

920
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,470
changed his mind because in 2023 which

921
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,589
is when we last met he said the aim was

922
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:22,470
for um a slow takeoff which is sort of

923
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,069
gradual deployment and open AI's 203

924
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:28,310
2023 note says a slower takeoff is

925
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,630
easier to make safe and they prefer

926
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,470
iterative rollouts society can adapt in

927
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,390
2025

928
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,390
>> they changed their mind and Sam Altman

929
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,349
said

930
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,510
He now thinks a fast takeoff is more

931
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,030
possible than he did a couple of years

932
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,910
ago on the order of a small number of

933
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:50,069
years rather than a decade. Um, and it

934
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:52,230
to define what we mean by a fast

935
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,950
takeoff, it's defined as when AI goes

936
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,430
from roughly human level to far beyond

937
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,790
human very quickly, think months to a

938
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,870
few years, faster than governments,

939
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,349
companies, or society can adapt with

940
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:07,349
little warning, big power shifts, and

941
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:09,670
hard to control. A slow takeoff, by

942
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,589
contrast, is where capabilities climb

943
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,430
gradually over many years with lots of

944
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,390
warning shots. Um, and the red flags for

945
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,109
a fast takeoff is when AI can

946
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:21,990
self-improve, run autonomous research

947
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,990
and development and scale with massive

948
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,310
compute compounding gains which will

949
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,950
snowball fast. So, and I think from the

950
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,550
video that I watched of Sam Orman

951
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,750
recently, who again is the founder of

952
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,790
Open Air and HBT, he basically says, and

953
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,230
again I'm paraphrasing here. I will put

954
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,430
it on the screen. We have this community

955
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,550
knows things so I'll write it on the

956
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,430
screen. But he effectively said that

957
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,310
whoever gets to AGI first will have the

958
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,190
technology

959
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,790
>> to develop super intelligence

960
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,510
>> where the AI can can rapidly increase

961
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,430
its own intelligence and it will

962
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,750
basically leave everyone else behind.

963
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,150
>> Yes. Uh so that last bit is debatable

964
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:01,109
but but let's just agree that uh so so

965
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:03,109
in in a live uh you know one of the

966
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:05,750
posts I shared and got a lot of

967
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,910
interest is I refer to the the Altman as

968
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,950
a brand not as a human. Okay. So the

969
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,150
Altman is that uh persona of a

970
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,190
California disruptive technologist that

971
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,150
disrespects everyone. Okay. and believes

972
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,230
that disruption is good for humanity and

973
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,310
believes that this is good for safety

974
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,310
and like everything else like we say war

975
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,430
is for democracy and freedom they say uh

976
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,589
developing you know putting AI on the

977
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:36,630
open internet is good for everyone right

978
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,870
it allows us to learn from our mistakes

979
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:43,430
that was Sam Altman's 2023 spiel and if

980
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,589
you recall at the time I was like this

981
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,190
is the most dangerous you know one of

982
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,470
the clips that really went viral you so

983
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,069
you're you're so clever at finding the

984
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:52,950
right clips is when I said

985
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,630
>> I didn't I didn't do the clipping mate

986
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,870
>> they're team teams remember the clip

987
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,630
where I said we fucked up we always said

988
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,710
don't put them on the open internet

989
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,109
until we know what we're putting out in

990
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:06,470
the world I'm going to be saying that

991
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,030
>> yeah we we we fucked up on putting it on

992
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,589
the open internet teaching it to to code

993
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:14,470
and putting you know agents AI agents

994
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,870
prompting other AIs now AI agents

995
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,310
prompting other AIs are leading to

996
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,109
self-developing AIS and and The problem

997
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:24,230
is, of course, we, you know, anyone who

998
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,069
has been on the inside of this knew that

999
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:29,270
this was just a clever spiel made by a

1000
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,030
PR manager for Sam Altman to sit with his

1001
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,950
dreamy eyes in front of Congress and

1002
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,790
say, "We want you to regulate us." Now,

1003
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,109
they're saying, "We're unregulable."

1004
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,109
Okay? And and when you really understand

1005
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:45,109
what's happening here, what's happening

1006
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:48,470
is it's so fast

1007
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,030
that none of them has the choice to slow

1008
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,990
down. It's impossible. Neither China

1009
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,430
versus America or OpenAI versus Google.

1010
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,069
the that the the only thing that I may

1011
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:03,270
have may see happening that you you know

1012
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,349
that that may differ a little bit from

1013
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:07,829
your statement is if one of them gets

1014
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:10,950
there first uh then they dominate for

1015
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,829
the rest of humanity that is probably

1016
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:16,870
true if they get there first uh with

1017
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,910
within enough buffer. Okay. But the way

1018
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,109
you look at Grock coming a week after

1019
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:25,829
open AI, a week after uh you know

1020
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:27,990
Gemini, a week after Claude and then

1021
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,310
Claude comes again and then China

1022
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,750
releases something and then Korea

1023
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,230
releases some something. It is so fast

1024
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,109
that we may get a few of them at the

1025
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:40,470
same time or a few months apart. Okay,

1026
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,109
before one of them has enough power to

1027
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:45,589
become dominant. And that is a very

1028
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,670
interesting scenario.

1029
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,950
multiple AIs, all super intelligent.

1030
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,550
>> It's funny, you know, I I got asked

1031
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,230
yesterday, I was in I was in Belgium on

1032
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,069
stage. There was, I don't know, maybe

1033
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:58,390
4,000 people in the audience and a kid

1034
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,470
stood up and he was like, um, you've had

1035
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,990
a lot of conversations in the last year

1036
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,470
about AI. Like, why do you care? And I

1037
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,430
don't think people realize how,

1038
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,870
even though I've had so many

1039
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,950
conversations on this podcast about AI,

1040
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,109
you

1041
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:12,310
>> haven't made up your mind.

1042
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,630
>> I I have more questions than ever.

1043
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,230
>> I know. And it's and it doesn't seem

1044
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,630
that anyone can satiate.

1045
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,150
>> Anyone that tells you they can predict

1046
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,829
the future is arrogant.

1047
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:22,150
>> Yeah.

1048
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,790
>> It is. It's never moved so fast.

1049
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,470
>> It's nothing like nothing I've ever

1050
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,310
seen. And you know, by the time that we

1051
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,750
leave this conversation and I go to my

1052
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,589
computer, there's going to be some

1053
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:33,910
incredible new technology or application

1054
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,390
of AI that didn't exist when I woke up

1055
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,470
this morning. That creates probably

1056
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,069
another paradigm shift in my brain.

1057
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:41,910
Also, you know, I people have different

1058
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,349
opinions of Elon Musk and they're

1059
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:45,349
they're entitled to their own opinion,

1060
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:46,950
but the other day, only a couple of days

1061
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,349
ago, he did a tweet where he said, "At

1062
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:52,310
times, AI existential dread is

1063
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:55,829
overwhelming." And on the same day, he

1064
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:58,550
tweeted, "I resisted AI for too long,

1065
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:03,030
living in denial. Now it is game on."

1066
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,349
And he tagged his AI companies. I don't

1067
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:06,630
know what to make of I don't know what

1068
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,030
to make of those tweets. I don't know.

1069
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,470
And you know, I

1070
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,150
I try really hard to figure out if

1071
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,190
someone like Sam Wman has the best

1072
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,630
interests of society at heart.

1073
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,910
>> No.

1074
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,349
>> Or if these people are just like

1075
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:29,190
>> I'm saying that publicly. No.

1076
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,030
As a matter of fact, so I know Sundar

1077
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:35,109
Pichai. I work CEO of Alphabet, Google's

1078
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:37,589
parent company. an amazing human being

1079
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:39,829
on in all honesty. I know Demis Hassabis

1080
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:42,790
is amazing human being. Okay. Uh you

1081
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:47,030
know these are are ethical incredible uh

1082
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,390
humans at heart. They have no choice.

1083
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,309
Uh Sund by law

1084
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:57,750
is uh demanded to take care of his his

1085
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:00,390
shareholder value. That's that is his

1086
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:00,870
job.

1087
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,790
>> But Sund you said you know him. You used

1088
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,750
to work at Google.

1089
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,510
>> Yeah. He's not going to do anything that

1090
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,270
he thinks is going to harm humanity.

1091
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,829
>> But if if he does not continue to

1092
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:13,670
advance AI, that by definition uh uh uh

1093
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,510
contradicts his responsibility as the

1094
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,510
CEO of a publicly traded company, he is

1095
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,550
liable by law to continue to advance the

1096
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,150
agenda. There's absolutely no doubt

1097
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,630
about it. Now, so but but he's a good

1098
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,390
person at heart. Deis is a good person

1099
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,790
at heart. So they're trying so hard to

1100
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,390
make it safe. Okay? As much as they can.

1101
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,470
Reality however is the the the disruptor

1102
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,829
the Altman as a brand doesn't care that

1103
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:40,550
much.

1104
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,750
>> How do you know that?

1105
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,069
>> In reality the disruptor is someone that

1106
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:46,309
comes in with the objective of I don't

1107
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:48,069
like the status quo. I have a different

1108
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:50,630
approach. And that different approach if

1109
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:54,390
you just look at the story was we are a

1110
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,510
nonforprofit that is funded mostly by

1111
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,829
Elon Musk money. It's not entirely by

1112
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:01,510
Elon Musk money. So context for people

1113
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,750
that might not understand Open AI. The

1114
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,190
reason I always give context is funnily

1115
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,710
enough I think I told you this last

1116
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,230
time. I went to a prison where they play

1117
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,430
the D of CEO.

1118
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,069
>> No way.

1119
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:11,510
>> So they play the D of CO and I think

1120
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,510
it's 50 prisons in the UK to young

1121
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:13,990
offenders

1122
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,349
>> and no violence there.

1123
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:16,790
>> Well, I don't know. I can't I can't I

1124
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,069
can't tell you whether violence has gone

1125
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:20,069
up or down. But I was in the cell with

1126
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:21,589
one of the prisoners, a young a young

1127
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,430
black guy, and I was in his cell for for

1128
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,790
a little while. I was reading through

1129
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,710
his business plan, etc. And I said, "You

1130
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,069
know what? You need to listen to this

1131
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:29,670
conversation that I did with Mo Gawdat."

1132
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,670
So I he has a little screen in his cell.

1133
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,190
So I pulled it up, you know, our first

1134
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,309
conversation. I said, "You should listen

1135
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:35,510
to that one." And he said to me, he

1136
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,430
said, "I can't listen to that one cuz

1137
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,430
you guys use big words."

1138
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,030
>> So ever since that day, which was about

1139
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,270
>> I noticed that about days four years

1140
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,390
ago, sorry.

1141
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,870
>> I've always whenever I hear a big word,

1142
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,150
I think about this kid.

1143
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:48,470
>> Yeah.

1144
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,710
>> And I say like give context. So even

1145
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,630
with the you're about to explain what

1146
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,069
Open AI is, I know he won't know what

1147
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:56,470
Open AI's origin story was. That's why

1148
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,190
I'm

1149
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,870
>> I think that's a wonderful practice in

1150
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,470
general. By the way, even, you know,

1151
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,030
being a non native English speaker,

1152
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,950
>> you'll be amazed how often a word is

1153
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,870
said to me and I I'm like, yeah, don't

1154
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:07,829
know what that means.

1155
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:09,510
>> So, like I've actually never said this

1156
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,910
publicly before, but I now see it as my

1157
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,829
responsibility to be to to keep the draw

1158
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:17,670
the drawbridge

1159
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,910
to accessibility of these conversations

1160
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,589
down for him. So, whenever I whenever

1161
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:25,109
there's a word that at some point in my

1162
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:27,030
life I didn't know what it meant,

1163
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,309
>> I will go back. I was like, what does

1164
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:29,589
that mean? I think that I've noticed

1165
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:31,349
that in the you know more and more in

1166
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,270
your podcast and I really appreciate and

1167
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,430
we also show it on the screen sometimes.

1168
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,349
>> I think that's wonderful. I mean the

1169
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:40,069
the the origin story of open AI is as

1170
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:42,710
the name suggests it's open source. It's

1171
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,030
for the public good. It was an in you

1172
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,630
know intended in Elon Musk's words to

1173
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,109
save the world from the dangers of AI

1174
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:52,710
right so they were doing research on

1175
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,030
that and then you know there was the

1176
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,510
disagreement between Sam Altman and and

1177
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:01,109
Elon somehow Elon ends up being out of

1178
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:03,910
uh of uh of open AI. I think there was a

1179
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,510
moment in time where he tried to take it

1180
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,670
back and you know the board rejected it

1181
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,550
or some something like that. most of the

1182
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,750
uh top um safety engineers, the top

1183
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:17,750
technical teams in open AI left in 2023

1184
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,950
2024 openly saying we're not concerned

1185
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,510
with safety anymore. It moves from being

1186
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,829
a nonforprofit to being one of the most

1187
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:27,750
valued companies in the world. There are

1188
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,710
billions of dollars at stake, right? And

1189
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,910
if you if you tell me that Sam Altman is

1190
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:37,990
out there trying to help humanity, let's

1191
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,470
let's suggest to him and say, "Hey, do

1192
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:41,750
you want to do that for free? We'll pay

1193
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,670
you a very good salary, but you don't

1194
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,309
have stocks in this. Saving humanity

1195
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:47,589
doesn't come at the billion dollar

1196
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:50,470
valuation or of course now tens of

1197
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,630
billions or hundreds of billions." And

1198
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:56,390
and and see truly that is when you know

1199
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,630
that someone is doing it for the good of

1200
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,430
humanity. Now the the capitalist system

1201
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,430
we've built is not built for the good of

1202
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,950
humanity. It's built for the good of the

1203
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:05,750
capitalist.

1204
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,870
>> Well, he might say that releasing the

1205
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,470
model publicly, open sourcing it is too

1206
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,990
risky

1207
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,470
because then bad actors around the world

1208
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,109
would have access to that technology. So

1209
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:23,109
he might say that closing open AI in

1210
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:26,550
terms of not making it publicly viewable

1211
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,309
is the right thing to do for safety. We

1212
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:30,470
go back to gullible cheer leaders,

1213
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,270
right? One of the interesting tricks is

1214
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,790
of lying in our world is everyone will

1215
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,990
say what helps their agenda. Follow the

1216
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,390
money. Okay, you follow the money and

1217
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,550
you find that you know at a point in

1218
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:48,550
time Samman himself was saying it's open

1219
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:52,069
AI. Okay, my benefit at the time is to

1220
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:53,750
give it to the world so that the world

1221
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,349
looks at it. They know the code if there

1222
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:57,750
is if there are any bugs and so on. True

1223
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:00,550
statement. Also a true statement is if I

1224
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,790
put it out there in the world, a

1225
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,710
criminal might take that model and build

1226
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,309
something that's against humanity as a

1227
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:09,349
result. Also true statement. Capitalists

1228
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:11,109
will choose which one of the truths to

1229
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:13,829
say, right? Based on which part of the

1230
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:16,150
agenda, which part of their life today

1231
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:19,349
they want to serve, right? Someone will

1232
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:22,390
say, uh, you know, do I do you want me

1233
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,309
to be controversial?

1234
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:26,390
Let's not go there. But if we go back to

1235
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,589
war, I'll give you 400 slogans.

1236
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:33,589
400 slogans that we all hear that change

1237
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:35,990
based on the day and the army and the

1238
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,710
location and the they're all slogans.

1239
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,190
None of them is true. You want to know

1240
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,270
the truth. You follow the money, not

1241
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,510
what the person is saying, but ask

1242
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,390
yourself why is the person saying that?

1243
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,710
What's in it for the person speaking?

1244
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,390
>> And what do you think's in it for Chachi

1245
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,750
Samman? hundreds of billions of dollars

1246
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,829
of of of valuation.

1247
00:47:57,839 --> 00:47:59,030
>> And do you think it's that power?

1248
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,109
>> The ego of being the person that

1249
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:05,109
invented AGI, the position of power that

1250
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:07,030
this gives you, the meetings with all of

1251
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,950
the heads of states, the admiration that

1252
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:12,790
gets it, it is intoxicating

1253
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,390
>> 100%

1254
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,990
100%.

1255
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,309
Okay. And and the real question, this is

1256
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:20,230
a question I ask everyone. Did you see

1257
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,549
you didn't you're every time I ask you

1258
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:24,150
you say you didn't. Did you see the

1259
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,349
movie Elysium?

1260
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:27,349
>> No. You'd be surprised how little movie

1261
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:28,950
watching I do. You'd be shocked.

1262
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,390
>> There are some movies that are very

1263
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,790
interesting. I use them to to create an

1264
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,030
emotional attachment to a story that you

1265
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,790
haven't seen yet because you may have

1266
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,190
seen it in a movie. Okay. Elissium is a

1267
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,430
is a society where the elites are living

1268
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,829
on the moon. Okay. They don't need

1269
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:45,829
peasants to do the work anymore and

1270
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:49,750
everyone else is living down here. Okay.

1271
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,790
You have to imagine that if again game

1272
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,190
theory you have to im you know picture

1273
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,030
something to infinity to its extreme and

1274
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,910
see where it goes and the extreme of a

1275
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,230
world where all manufactured is done

1276
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,870
manufacturing is done by machines

1277
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,190
where all decisions are made by machines

1278
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,309
and those machines are owned by a few

1279
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:12,710
is not an economy similar to the to

1280
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,910
today to the to today's economy

1281
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:19,910
that today's economy is an economy of

1282
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,069
consumerism and and product and

1283
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:24,630
production. You know, it's the it's the

1284
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:27,109
in in alive I call it the invention of

1285
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:29,589
more. The invention of more is that post

1286
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:32,870
World War II as the factories were

1287
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,109
rolling out things and prosperity was

1288
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:37,510
happening everywhere in America. There

1289
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,430
was a time where every family had enough

1290
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:40,870
of everything.

1291
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,950
>> But for the capitalist to continue to be

1292
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,109
profitable, they needed to convince you

1293
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:47,349
that what you had was not enough. either

1294
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,510
by making it obsolete like fashion or

1295
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,829
like you know a new shape of a car or

1296
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:53,990
whatever or by convincing you that there

1297
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,549
are more things in life that you need so

1298
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:58,230
that you become complete without those

1299
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:01,190
things you don't and and that invention

1300
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,150
of more gets us to where we are today an

1301
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,950
economy that's based on production

1302
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,190
consumed and if you look at the US

1303
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:13,109
economy today 62% of the US economy GDP

1304
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:15,990
is consumption it's not production okay

1305
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,790
Now, this requires that the consumers

1306
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,870
have enough purchasing power to to buy

1307
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,710
what is produced. And I believe that

1308
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,950
this will be an economy that will take

1309
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:31,349
us hopefully in the next 10, 15, 20

1310
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:33,750
years and forever. But that's not

1311
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:36,230
guaranteed. Why? Because on one side if

1312
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,950
UBI replaces purchasing power. So if

1313
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,109
people have to get an income from the

1314
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:44,549
government which is basically taxes

1315
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:46,790
collected from those using AI and robots

1316
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,270
to to make things

1317
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,829
the then the the mindset of capitalism

1318
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:54,870
labor arbitrage means those people are

1319
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,470
not producing anything and they're

1320
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:59,109
costing me money. Why don't we pay them

1321
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:01,510
less and less and maybe even not pay

1322
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:04,069
them at all? And that becomes illissium

1323
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:06,309
where you basically say, you know, we

1324
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:09,430
sit somewhere protected from everyone.

1325
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,910
We have the machines do all of our work

1326
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,069
and those need to worry about

1327
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:15,670
themselves. We're not going to pay them

1328
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:18,630
UBI anymore, right? And and you have to

1329
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:22,549
imagine this idea of UBI assumes this

1330
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:27,670
very democratic caring society.

1331
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:31,990
UBI in itself is communism.

1332
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,990
Think of the ideology between at least

1333
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,230
socialism. The ideology of giving

1334
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,710
everyone what they need. That's not the

1335
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,230
capitalist

1336
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,069
democratic society that the west

1337
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:45,190
advocates. So those transitions are

1338
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,510
massive in magnitude.

1339
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:50,390
And for those transitions to happen, I

1340
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,710
believe the right thing to do when the

1341
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:55,109
cost of producing everything is almost

1342
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:57,990
zero because of AI and robots.

1343
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,309
because the cost of harvesting energy

1344
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:02,390
should actually tend to zero once we get

1345
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,470
more intelligent to harvest the energy

1346
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:07,510
out of thin air. Then a possible

1347
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,589
scenario and and I believe a scenario

1348
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:13,349
that AI will eventually do in the utopia

1349
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:15,910
is yeah anyone can get anything they

1350
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,750
want. Don't over consume. We're not

1351
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,230
going to abuse the the planet resources

1352
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,950
but it costs nothing. So like the old

1353
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:25,109
days where we were hunter gatherers, you

1354
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:27,510
would, you know, forge for some berries

1355
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:30,470
and you'll find them ready in in nature.

1356
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,750
Okay, we can in 10 years time, 12 years

1357
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:36,950
time build a society where you can forge

1358
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,190
for an iPhone in nature. It will be made

1359
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,510
out of thin air. Nanopysics will allow

1360
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:44,790
you to do that. Okay? But the challenge,

1361
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,790
believe it or not, is not tech. The

1362
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,870
challenge is a mindset. Because the

1363
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:51,829
elite, why would they give you that for

1364
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:55,030
free? Okay. And the system would morph

1365
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,589
into, no, no, hold on. We will make more

1366
00:52:57,599 --> 00:52:59,829
money. We will be bigger capitalists. We

1367
00:52:59,839 --> 00:53:02,069
will feed our ego and hunger for power

1368
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:05,670
more and more. And for them, give them

1369
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,390
UBI and then 3 weeks later give them

1370
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:09,430
less UBI.

1371
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:10,790
>> Aren't there going to be lots of new

1372
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,390
jobs created though? Because when we

1373
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,270
think about the other revolutions over

1374
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:16,630
time, whether it was the industrial

1375
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,470
revolution or other sort of big

1376
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,309
technological revolutions,

1377
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:22,549
>> in the moment we forecasted that

1378
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:24,549
everyone was going to lose their jobs,

1379
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:26,230
>> but we couldn't see all the new jobs

1380
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,349
that were being created

1381
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:30,309
>> because the the the machines

1382
00:53:30,319 --> 00:53:32,470
replaced the human strength at a point

1383
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:35,190
in time. And very few places in the west

1384
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:39,510
today will have a worker carry things on

1385
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:42,150
their back and carry it upstairs. The

1386
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,750
machine does that work. Correct.

1387
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:44,230
>> Yeah.

1388
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:47,190
>> Uh similarly

1389
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,510
AI is going to replace the brain of a

1390
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:52,390
human. And when the west in its

1391
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,510
interesting uh virtual colonies that I

1392
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:58,069
call it uh basically outsourced all

1393
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:01,589
labor to the to the developing nations.

1394
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:03,910
What the West publicly said at the time

1395
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,309
is we're we're going to be a services

1396
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:08,230
economy. We we're we're not interested

1397
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,069
in making things and stitching things

1398
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:12,470
and so on. Let the Indians and Chinese

1399
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,190
and you know Bengali and Vietnamese do

1400
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,109
that. We're going to do more refined

1401
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:18,950
jobs. Knowledge workers. We're going to

1402
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,030
call them. Knowledge workers are people

1403
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,589
who work with information and click on a

1404
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:25,750
keyboard and move a mouse and you know

1405
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,910
sit in meetings and all we produce in

1406
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:30,870
the western societies is what words

1407
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:33,430
right or designs maybe sometimes but

1408
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:36,150
everything we produce can be produced by

1409
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:40,470
an AI.

1410
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:44,720
So if I give you an AI tomorrow h where

1411
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,790
I give you a piece of land, I give the

1412
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:48,470
AI a piece of land and I say here are

1413
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,230
the parameters of my land. Here is its

1414
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:53,190
location on Google maps. Design an

1415
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,510
architecturally sound villa for me. I

1416
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:57,670
care about a lot of light and I need

1417
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,829
three bedrooms. I want my bathrooms to

1418
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:02,710
be in white marble, whatever. And the AI

1419
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,470
produces it like that. How often will

1420
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:09,109
you go to an to an architect and say

1421
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:12,390
right so what will the architect do the

1422
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,230
best of the best of the architects will

1423
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:16,710
either use AI to produce that or you

1424
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:19,030
will consult with them and say hey you

1425
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,589
know I've seen this and they'll say it's

1426
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:23,910
really pretty but it wouldn't feel right

1427
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,150
for the person that you are yeah those

1428
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:27,670
jobs will remain but how many of them

1429
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,750
will remain

1430
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:32,950
how how often do you think uh how many

1431
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,790
more years. Do you think I will be able

1432
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,710
to create a book that is smarter than

1433
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:40,390
AI?

1434
00:55:43,030 --> 00:55:43,040
Not many. I will still be able to

1435
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,870
connect to a human. You're not going to

1436
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,950
hug an AI when you meet them like you

1437
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:50,230
hug me, right? But that's not enough of

1438
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,789
a job.

1439
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:54,950
So why do I say that? Remember I asked

1440
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,870
you at the beginning of the podcast to

1441
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,829
remind me of solutions. Why do I say

1442
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:02,630
that? Because there are ideological

1443
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:05,589
shifts and and concrete actions that

1444
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:07,990
need to be taken by governments today

1445
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,069
rather than waiting until COVID is

1446
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:11,670
already everywhere and then locking

1447
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:13,990
everyone down. Governments could have

1448
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,230
reacted before the first patient or at

1449
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,309
least at patient zero or at least at

1450
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:21,270
patient 50. They didn't. H what I'm

1451
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:24,630
trying to say is there is no doubt that

1452
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:27,349
lots of jobs will be lost. There's no

1453
00:56:27,359 --> 00:56:29,190
doubt that there will be sectors of

1454
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:33,990
society where 10 20 30 40 50% of all

1455
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,710
developers, all software uh you know all

1456
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:40,230
graphic designers, all um uh uh u online

1457
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:43,829
marketers, all all all assistances

1458
00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:46,710
are going to be out of a job. So are we

1459
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,630
prepared as a society to do that? Can we

1460
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:50,390
tell our governments there is an

1461
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,870
ideological shift? This is very close to

1462
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:55,349
social socialism and and communism.

1463
00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:58,470
Okay. And are we ready from a budget

1464
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:00,950
point of view instead of spending a a

1465
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,510
trillion dollars a year on on arms and

1466
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:06,549
and explosives and you know autonomous

1467
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:08,630
weapons that will oppress people because

1468
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:11,670
we can't feed them? Can we please shift

1469
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:14,470
that? I did those numbers. Huh. Uh again

1470
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,470
I go back to military spending because

1471
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:21,109
it's all around us. 2.71 trillion. 2.4

1472
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:24,309
to2.7 is the estimate of 2024. how much

1473
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:25,990
money we're spending on military

1474
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,829
>> on Yeah. on military equipment on things

1475
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:30,710
that we're going to explode into smoke

1476
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:33,430
and death. Extreme poverty worldwide.

1477
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:35,030
Extreme poverty is people that are below

1478
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,589
the poverty line. Extreme poverty

1479
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:39,990
everywhere in the world could end for 10

1480
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,789
to 12% of that budget. So if we replace

1481
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:46,549
our military spending 10% of that to go

1482
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:48,150
to people who are in extreme poverty,

1483
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:50,150
nobody will be poor in the world. Okay.

1484
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:54,230
You can end uh world hunger for less

1485
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,870
than 4%. Nobody would be hungry in the

1486
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,589
world. You know, if you take uh again 10

1487
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:03,270
to 12% universal healthcare, every human

1488
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:05,270
being on the planet would have free

1489
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:08,230
healthcare for 10 to 12% on what we're

1490
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:11,030
spending on war. Now, why why do I say

1491
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,630
this when we're talking about AI?

1492
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:15,910
Because that's a simple decision. If we

1493
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:18,069
stop fighting

1494
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:20,230
because money itself does not have the

1495
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:22,390
same meaning anymore because the

1496
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,470
economics of money is going to change

1497
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:26,470
because the entire meaning of capitalism

1498
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:28,230
is ending because there is no more need

1499
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:30,630
for labor arbitrage because AI is doing

1500
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,470
everything

1501
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:36,150
just with the $2.4 trillion we save in

1502
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:38,789
explosives every year in arms and

1503
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:42,150
weapons just for that universal

1504
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:44,870
healthcare and extreme poverty. You

1505
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,470
could actually one of the calculations

1506
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,789
is you could end climate or combat

1507
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:51,510
climate climate change meaningfully for

1508
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,910
100% of the military budget.

1509
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,670
>> But I I'm not even sure it's really

1510
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,829
about the money. I think money is a

1511
00:58:57,839 --> 00:58:59,190
measurement stick of power. Right.

1512
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,789
>> Exactly. It's printed on demand.

1513
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:02,470
>> So even in a world where we have super

1514
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,710
intelligence and money is no longer a

1515
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:05,190
problem.

1516
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:05,910
>> Correct.

1517
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:08,069
>> I still think

1518
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:10,789
power is going to be

1519
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:12,549
insatiable for so many people. So there

1520
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:15,589
will still be war because you know

1521
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:17,349
>> there will be in my view

1522
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:19,349
>> the strongest I want the strongest AI. I

1523
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:19,910
don't want my

1524
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:21,270
>> and I don't and I don't want you know

1525
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:23,510
what Harry Henry Kissinger called them

1526
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:24,950
the eaters.

1527
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:25,910
>> The eaters.

1528
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,990
>> Yeah.

1529
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,670
Brutal as that sounds.

1530
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:31,270
>> What is that? The people at the bottom

1531
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:32,390
of the socioeconomic

1532
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:35,190
>> that don't produce but consume.

1533
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:37,430
So if you had a Henry Kissinger at the

1534
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:40,789
at the helm and we have so many of them,

1535
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:44,870
what would they think like why why

1536
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,950
prominent military figure in the US

1537
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:50,470
history? Uh you know what why would we

1538
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:53,829
feed 350 million Americans America will

1539
00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:56,069
think but more interestingly why do we

1540
00:59:56,079 --> 00:59:59,190
even care about Bangladesh anymore if we

1541
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,349
can't make our textiles there or we

1542
01:00:01,359 --> 01:00:03,510
don't want to make our textile there. Do

1543
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:05,829
you you know I imagine throughout human

1544
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:09,109
history if we had podcasts conversations

1545
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:11,750
would would have been warning of a

1546
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,430
dystopia around the corner. You know

1547
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,030
when they heard of technology and the

1548
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:15,990
internet they would have said oh we're

1549
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,990
finished and when the the tractor came

1550
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,270
along they would have said oh god we're

1551
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:20,230
finished because we're not going to be

1552
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:22,150
able to farm anymore. So is this not

1553
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,990
just another one of those moments where

1554
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,910
we couldn't see around the corner so we

1555
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:29,670
we forecasted unfortunate things. You

1556
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:32,789
could be. I am I'm begging that I'm

1557
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:35,589
wrong. Okay. I'm just asking if there

1558
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:37,589
are scenarios that you think that can

1559
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:39,910
provide that. You know, uh uh Mustafa

1560
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:42,710
Sulleman in in uh you hosted him here. I

1561
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,470
did. Yeah. He was in the coming wave.

1562
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:44,870
>> Yeah.

1563
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:48,230
>> And he speaks about uh about pessimism

1564
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,910
aversion.

1565
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:52,789
Okay. that all of us people who are

1566
01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:54,230
supposed to be in technology and

1567
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:55,670
business and so on, we're always

1568
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:57,510
supposed to, you know, stand on stage

1569
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:58,710
and say the future's going to be

1570
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:01,190
amazing. You know, this technology I'm

1571
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,190
building is going to make everything

1572
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:05,910
better. One of my posts in life was

1573
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:08,150
called the broken promises. How often

1574
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:09,510
did that happen?

1575
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:11,910
>> Okay. How often did social media connect

1576
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:14,630
us? And how many and how often did it

1577
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,950
make us more lonely? How how often did

1578
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:19,829
mobile phones make us work less? That

1579
01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:22,549
was the promise. That was the promise.

1580
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:25,030
The promise. The early ads of Nokia were

1581
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:27,990
people at parties. Is that your

1582
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,430
experience of mobile phones? And and I

1583
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:34,069
think the whole idea is we should hope

1584
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:35,990
there will be other roles for humanity.

1585
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,470
By the way, those roles would resemble

1586
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:40,470
the times where we were hunter

1587
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:42,309
gatherers, just a lot more technology

1588
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:44,150
and a lot more safety.

1589
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:46,069
>> Okay. So, this is this sounds good.

1590
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:46,309
>> Yeah,

1591
01:01:46,319 --> 01:01:47,990
>> this is exciting. So, I'm gonna I'm

1592
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,470
gonna get to go outside more, be with my

1593
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:51,190
friends more,

1594
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:52,230
>> 100%.

1595
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:52,870
>> Fantastic.

1596
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,549
>> And do absolutely nothing.

1597
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:55,910
>> Well, that doesn't sound fantastic.

1598
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,910
>> No, it does. Do be forced to do

1599
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:59,109
absolutely nothing. For some people,

1600
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:00,950
it's amazing. For you and I, we're going

1601
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:02,789
to find the little carpentry project and

1602
01:02:02,799 --> 01:02:03,510
just do something.

1603
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:04,870
>> Speak for yourself. I'm still People are

1604
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:05,910
still going to tune in.

1605
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:07,670
>> Okay.

1606
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:10,069
>> Correct. Yeah. But what? And people are

1607
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:11,109
going to to tune in.

1608
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:12,470
>> Do you think they will? I'm not I'm not

1609
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:14,710
I'm not convinced they will. And for for

1610
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:15,270
as long

1611
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:17,030
>> will you guys tune in? Are you guys

1612
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:17,910
still going to tune in?

1613
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:20,630
>> I can let them answer. I believe for as

1614
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:25,190
long as you make their life enriched,

1615
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,670
>> but can an AI do that better

1616
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:29,430
>> without the human connection?

1617
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:30,630
>> Comment below. Are you going to listen

1618
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:32,630
to an AI or the Davosio? Let me know in

1619
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:33,829
the comment section below.

1620
01:02:33,839 --> 01:02:36,230
>> Remember, as incredibly intelligent as

1621
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:39,109
you are, Steve, uh there will be a

1622
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:40,549
moment in time where you're going to

1623
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:43,190
sound really dumb compared to an AI. and

1624
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,670
and and I will sound completely dumb.

1625
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:46,549
>> Yeah. Yeah.

1626
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:49,910
>> The the depth the depth of analysis

1627
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:52,309
and and gold nuggets. I mean, can you

1628
01:02:52,319 --> 01:02:55,670
imagine two super intelligences deciding

1629
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:59,349
to get together and explain um string

1630
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:01,750
theory to us?

1631
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:03,829
They'll do better than any physic

1632
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:06,470
physicist in the world because they

1633
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:08,069
possess the physics knowledge and they

1634
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:10,870
also pro possess social and language

1635
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:12,789
knowledge that most deep physicists

1636
01:03:12,799 --> 01:03:16,230
don't. I think B2B marketeteers keep

1637
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:18,150
making this mistake. They're chasing

1638
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:20,710
volume instead of quality. And when you

1639
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:22,710
try to be seen by more people instead of

1640
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,309
the right people, all you're doing is

1641
01:03:24,319 --> 01:03:26,230
making noise. But that noise rarely

1642
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:28,230
shifts the needle and it's often quite

1643
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:30,470
expensive. And I know as there was the

1644
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:31,910
time in my career where I kept making

1645
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:33,349
this mistake that many of you will be

1646
01:03:33,359 --> 01:03:35,589
making it too. Eventually I started

1647
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:37,430
posting ads on our show sponsors

1648
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,029
platform LinkedIn. And that's when

1649
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:40,870
things started to change. I put that

1650
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:42,950
change down to a few critical things.

1651
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:44,789
One of them being that LinkedIn was then

1652
01:03:44,799 --> 01:03:46,789
and still is today the platform where

1653
01:03:46,799 --> 01:03:49,109
decision makers go to not only to think

1654
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:51,190
and learn but also to buy. And when you

1655
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:52,710
market your business there, you're

1656
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:54,309
putting it right in front of people who

1657
01:03:54,319 --> 01:03:56,630
actually have the power to say yes. and

1658
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:58,390
you can target them by job title,

1659
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,630
industry, and company size. It's simply

1660
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:02,309
a sharper way to spend your marketing

1661
01:04:02,319 --> 01:04:04,549
budget. And if you haven't tried it, how

1662
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:06,789
about this? Give LinkedIn ads a try, and

1663
01:04:06,799 --> 01:04:09,109
I'm going to give you a $100 ad credit

1664
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:10,789
to get you started. If you visit

1665
01:04:10,799 --> 01:04:12,950
linkedin.com/diary,

1666
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:15,029
you can claim that right now. That's

1667
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:17,589
linkedin.com/diary.

1668
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:18,950
I've I've really gone back and forward

1669
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:21,270
on this idea that even in podcasting

1670
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:23,910
that all the podcasts will be AI

1671
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:25,750
podcasts or I've gone back and forward

1672
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:27,270
on it and and where I landed at the end

1673
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,029
of the day was that there'll still be a

1674
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:32,390
category of media where you do want

1675
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,069
lived experience on something

1676
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:34,710
>> 100%.

1677
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:36,789
>> For example, like you want to know how

1678
01:04:36,799 --> 01:04:38,710
the person that you follow and admire

1679
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:40,390
dealt with their divorce.

1680
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:42,309
>> Yeah. Or or how they're struggling with

1681
01:04:42,319 --> 01:04:43,270
AI,

1682
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:45,349
>> for example. Yeah. Exactly. But I but I

1683
01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:47,910
think things like news, there are there

1684
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:49,750
are certain situations where just like

1685
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,510
straight news and straight facts and

1686
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:54,150
maybe a walk through history may be

1687
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:57,029
eroded away by AIS. But even in those

1688
01:04:57,039 --> 01:04:59,270
scenarios, you there's something about

1689
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:01,430
personality. And again, I hesitate

1690
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:03,190
here because I question myself. I'm not

1691
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,710
in the camp of people that are romantic,

1692
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:07,510
by the way. I'm like I'm trying to be as

1693
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:09,990
as orientated towards whatever is true,

1694
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,230
even if it's against my interests. And I

1695
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:13,510
hope people understand that about me.

1696
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:16,150
like um cuz even in my companies we

1697
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:17,589
experiment with like disrupting me with

1698
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:18,870
AI and some people will be aware of

1699
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:19,990
those experiments

1700
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,230
>> because there will be a mix of all there

1701
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:24,789
you can't imagine that the world will be

1702
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:27,109
completely just AI and completely just

1703
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:29,589
podcasters you know you'll see a mix of

1704
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:31,349
of both you'll see things that they do

1705
01:05:31,359 --> 01:05:33,109
better things that we do better

1706
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:35,109
>> the the the message I'm trying to say is

1707
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:36,950
we need to prep for that

1708
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:38,710
>> we need to be ready for that we need to

1709
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:40,630
be ready by you know talking to our

1710
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:42,950
governments and saying hey it looks like

1711
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:46,309
I'm a a parallegal and it looks like all

1712
01:05:46,319 --> 01:05:49,190
parallegals are going to be, you know,

1713
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:52,150
financial researchers or analysts or

1714
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:54,390
graphic designers or, you know, call

1715
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:56,870
center agents. It looks like half of

1716
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:58,630
those jobs are being replaced already.

1717
01:05:58,640 --> 01:05:59,910
>> You know who Jeffrey Hinton is?

1718
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:01,750
>> Oh, Jeffrey. I had him on the

1719
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:04,069
documentary as well. I love Jeffrey.

1720
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:05,510
>> Jeffrey Hinton told me

1721
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:06,950
>> trained to be a plumber.

1722
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:07,589
>> Really?

1723
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:10,710
>> Yeah. 100% for a while.

1724
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:13,029
>> And I thought he was joking. 100%.

1725
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:15,109
>> So I asked him again and he he looked me

1726
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:17,190
dead in the eye and told me that I I

1727
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:18,230
should train to be a plumber.

1728
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:23,109
>> 100%. So so so uh it's funny uh machines

1729
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:25,270
replaced labor but we still had blue

1730
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:28,150
collar. Then uh you know the refined

1731
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:30,230
jobs became white collar information

1732
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:30,789
workers.

1733
01:06:30,799 --> 01:06:32,150
>> What's the refined jobs?

1734
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:33,750
>> You know you don't have to really carry

1735
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:36,309
heavy stuff or deal with physical work.

1736
01:06:36,319 --> 01:06:38,390
You know you sit in an in an office and

1737
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,549
sit in meetings all day and blabber, you

1738
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:42,309
know, useless shit then that's your

1739
01:06:42,319 --> 01:06:45,829
job. Okay? And those jobs, funny enough,

1740
01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:48,549
in the reverse of that, because robotics

1741
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:51,190
are not ready yet. Okay. And I believe

1742
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:52,630
they're not ready because of a

1743
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:55,270
stubbornness on the on the robotics

1744
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:57,910
community around making them humanoids.

1745
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:58,309
>> Mhm.

1746
01:06:58,319 --> 01:06:59,990
>> Okay. Because it takes so much to

1747
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,190
perfect a human like action at proper

1748
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:05,990
speed. You could, you know, have many

1749
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,990
more robots that don't look like a human

1750
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,510
just like a self-driving car in

1751
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:12,549
California. Okay, that that does already

1752
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:15,589
replace drivers and and you know but but

1753
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:17,910
they're delayed. So the robotic the the

1754
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:21,349
replacement of physical manual labor is

1755
01:07:21,359 --> 01:07:23,829
going to take four to five years before

1756
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:26,390
it's possible at you know at at the

1757
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:30,470
quality of the AI replacing mental labor

1758
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:33,510
now and when that happens it's going to

1759
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:35,430
take a long cycle to manufacture enough

1760
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:37,750
robots so that they replace all of those

1761
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:40,150
jobs. that cycle will take longer. Blue

1762
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:41,430
collar will stay longer.

1763
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:43,589
>> So, I should move into blue collar and

1764
01:07:43,599 --> 01:07:44,870
shut down my office.

1765
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:47,190
>> I think you're you're not the problem.

1766
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:47,990
>> Okay, good.

1767
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,150
>> Let's put put it this way. There are

1768
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:52,870
many people that we should care about

1769
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:55,430
that are a simple travel agent or an

1770
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:57,029
assistant

1771
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:59,750
that will see if not replacement a

1772
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:02,150
reduction in the number of pings they're

1773
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:09,510
getting. Simple as that.

1774
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:13,200
And someone in, you know, ministries of

1775
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:15,270
labor around the world needs to sit down

1776
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:17,110
and say, "What are we going to do about

1777
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:20,390
that? What if all taxi drivers and Uber

1778
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:24,550
drivers in uh in California get replaced

1779
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:27,829
by self-driving cars? Should we start

1780
01:08:27,839 --> 01:08:30,229
thinking about that now, noticing that

1781
01:08:30,239 --> 01:08:33,110
that trajectory makes it look like a

1782
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:35,030
possibility?" I'm going to go back to

1783
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:36,390
this argument which is what a lot of

1784
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:39,269
people will be shouting. Yes, but there

1785
01:08:39,279 --> 01:08:41,110
will be new jobs or

1786
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:43,110
>> and I as I said other than human

1787
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:45,669
connection jobs, name me one.

1788
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:50,229
>> So I I've got three assistants, right?

1789
01:08:50,239 --> 01:08:53,829
Sophie, Liam B. And okay, in the near

1790
01:08:53,839 --> 01:08:55,990
term there might be, you know, with AI

1791
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,390
agents, I might not need them to help me

1792
01:08:58,400 --> 01:08:59,910
book flights anymore. or I might not

1793
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:01,829
need them to help do scheduling anymore.

1794
01:09:01,839 --> 01:09:03,669
Or even I've been messing around with

1795
01:09:03,679 --> 01:09:05,510
this new AI tool that my friend built

1796
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:07,430
and you basically when me and you trying

1797
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:08,870
to schedule something like this today, I

1798
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:10,470
just copy the AI in and it looks at your

1799
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:11,829
calendar looks at mine and schedules it

1800
01:09:11,839 --> 01:09:13,590
for for us. So there might not be

1801
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,510
scheduling needs, but my dog is sick at

1802
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:17,349
the moment. And as I left this morning,

1803
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:18,709
I was like, damn, he's like really sick

1804
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:19,990
and I've taken him to the vet over and

1805
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,269
over again. I really need someone to

1806
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:23,269
look after him and figure out what's

1807
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:25,110
wrong with him. So those kinds of

1808
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:28,309
responsibilities of like care. I don't

1809
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:30,550
disagree at all. Again, all

1810
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:33,590
>> and and I won't I'm not going to be I

1811
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:34,470
don't know how to say this in a nice

1812
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:35,990
way, but my assistants will still have

1813
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:39,910
their jobs, but I as a CEO will be

1814
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:41,510
asking them to do a different type of

1815
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:42,309
work.

1816
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:44,309
>> Correct. So, so, so this is the

1817
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:45,910
calculation everyone needs to be aware

1818
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:48,870
of that a lot of their current

1819
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:50,390
responsibility, whoever you are, if

1820
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:52,789
you're a parallegal, if you're whatever,

1821
01:09:52,799 --> 01:09:55,830
will be handed over. So, so let me

1822
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:57,830
explain it even more accurately. There

1823
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:01,030
will be two stages of our interactions

1824
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:02,550
with the machines. One is what I call

1825
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:05,990
the era of augmented intelligence. So,

1826
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,590
it's human intelligence augmented with

1827
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:10,390
AI doing the job. And then the following

1828
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:12,310
one is what I call the era of machine

1829
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:14,470
mastery. The job is done completely by

1830
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:17,510
an AI without a human in the loop. Okay.

1831
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:21,110
So in the era of augmented intelligence,

1832
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:23,750
your assistances will augment themselves

1833
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:26,709
with an AI to either be more productive.

1834
01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:27,189
>> Yeah.

1835
01:10:27,199 --> 01:10:31,110
>> Okay. Or interestingly to reduce the

1836
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:34,630
number of tasks that they need to do.

1837
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:37,430
Correct. Now the more the number of

1838
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:39,910
tasks get reduced, the more they'll have

1839
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:41,669
the bandwidth and ability to do tasks

1840
01:10:41,679 --> 01:10:44,229
like take care of your dog, right? or

1841
01:10:44,239 --> 01:10:46,550
tasks that you know basically is about

1842
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:48,630
meeting your guests or whatever human

1843
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:49,189
connection.

1844
01:10:49,199 --> 01:10:50,790
>> Yeah.

1845
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:53,270
>> Life connection

1846
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:56,070
but do you think you need three for that

1847
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:58,630
or maybe now that some tasks have been

1848
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:01,030
you know outsourced to AI will you need

1849
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:03,270
two? You can easily calculate that from

1850
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:06,070
call center agents. So from call center

1851
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:09,270
agents they're not firing everyone but

1852
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:10,950
they're taking the first part of the

1853
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:13,830
funnel and giving it to an AI. So

1854
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:16,709
instead of having 2,000 agents in a in a

1855
01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:18,229
call center, they can now do the job

1856
01:11:18,239 --> 01:11:21,350
with 1,800. I'm just making that number

1857
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:24,229
up. H society needs to think about the

1858
01:11:24,239 --> 01:11:25,189
200.

1859
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:26,790
>> And you're telling me that they won't

1860
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:29,030
move into other roles somewhere else.

1861
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:30,709
>> I am telling you I don't know what those

1862
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:31,750
roles are.

1863
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:33,430
>> Well, I think we should all be

1864
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:35,110
musicians. We should all be authors. We

1865
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:36,550
should all be artists. We should all be

1866
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:37,669
entertainers. We should all be

1867
01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:39,510
comedians. We should all these are roles

1868
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:41,590
that will remain.

1869
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:43,350
We should all be plumbers for the next 5

1870
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:46,950
to 10 years. Fantastic. Okay. But even

1871
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:50,390
that requires society to morph

1872
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:53,110
and societyy's not talking about it.

1873
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:54,790
Okay. I had this wonderful interview

1874
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:56,709
with friends of mine, Peter Dendez and

1875
01:11:56,719 --> 01:11:59,590
and some of our friends and and they

1876
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:01,189
were saying, "Oh, you know, the American

1877
01:12:01,199 --> 01:12:02,870
people are resilient. They're going to

1878
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:05,030
be entrepreneurs." I was like,

1879
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:06,709
seriously, you're expecting a truck

1880
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:09,189
driver that will be replaced by an

1881
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:11,750
autonomous truck to become an

1882
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:14,950
entrepreneur? Like, please put yourself

1883
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:18,149
in the shoes of real people,

1884
01:12:18,159 --> 01:12:19,910
right? You expect a single mother who

1885
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:24,310
has three jobs

1886
01:12:30,550 --> 01:12:30,560
And I'm not saying this is a dystopia.

1887
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:32,709
It's a dystopia if humanity manages it

1888
01:12:32,719 --> 01:12:35,510
badly. Why? Because this could be the

1889
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:37,669
utopia itself where that single mother

1890
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:40,550
does not need three jobs.

1891
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:43,110
Okay? If we of if of our society was

1892
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:45,830
just enough, that single mother should

1893
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:48,550
have never needed three jobs,

1894
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:51,189
right? But the problem is our capitalist

1895
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:53,669
mindset is labor arbitrage. Is that I

1896
01:12:53,679 --> 01:12:56,310
don't care what she goes through.

1897
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:57,990
You know, if if you're if you're

1898
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,229
generous in your assumption, you'll say

1899
01:13:00,239 --> 01:13:01,590
because, you know, of what I've been

1900
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:03,830
given, I've been blessed. or if you're

1901
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:05,510
mean in your assumption, it's going to

1902
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:08,229
be because she's an eater. I'm a a

1903
01:13:08,239 --> 01:13:10,550
successful businessman. The world is

1904
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:13,270
supposed to be fair. I work hard. I make

1905
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:15,510
money. We don't care about them.

1906
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:17,590
>> Are we asking of ourselves here

1907
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:19,990
something that is not inherent in the

1908
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,870
human condition? What I mean by that is

1909
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:26,149
the reason why me and you are in this my

1910
01:13:26,159 --> 01:13:27,910
office here. We're on the fourth or

1911
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:29,510
third floor of my office in central

1912
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:32,149
London. big office, 25,000 square feet

1913
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:34,229
with lights and internet connections and

1914
01:13:34,239 --> 01:13:37,510
Wi-Fi and modems and AI teams

1915
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:39,110
downstairs. The reason that all of this

1916
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:41,750
exists is because something inherent in

1917
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:44,950
my ancestors meant that they built and

1918
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:47,189
accomplished and grew and that was like

1919
01:13:47,199 --> 01:13:48,630
inherent in their DNA. There was

1920
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:51,189
something in their DNA that said we will

1921
01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:54,470
expand and conquer and accomplish. So

1922
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:55,990
that's they've passed that to us because

1923
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,669
we're their offspring and that's why we

1924
01:13:57,679 --> 01:13:59,430
find ourselves in these skyscrapers.

1925
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:01,110
There is truth to that story. It's not

1926
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:02,709
your ancestors,

1927
01:14:02,719 --> 01:14:03,030
>> right?

1928
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:04,310
>> What is it?

1929
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:06,709
>> It's the media brainwashing you

1930
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:07,189
>> really

1931
01:14:07,199 --> 01:14:07,990
>> 100%.

1932
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,990
>> But if if you look back before times of

1933
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:10,470
media

1934
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:10,950
>> Mhm.

1935
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:12,630
>> the reason why homo sapiens were so

1936
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:14,149
successful was because they were able to

1937
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:15,590
dominate other tribes

1938
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:16,950
>> through banding together and

1939
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:18,950
communication. They conquered all these

1940
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:22,630
other these other um whatever came

1941
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:24,310
before homo sapiens.

1942
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:26,950
>> Yeah. So, so the the reason humans were

1943
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:28,709
successful in my view is because they

1944
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:30,790
could form a tribe to start. It's not

1945
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:32,390
because of our intelligence. I always

1946
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:34,630
joke and say Einstein would be eaten in

1947
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:36,310
the jungle in 2 minutes.

1948
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:38,070
>> Right? You know, the reason why we

1949
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:39,990
succeeded is because Einstein could

1950
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,030
partner with a a big guy that protected

1951
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:44,950
him while he was working on relativity

1952
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:49,189
in the jungle. Right? Now the the the

1953
01:14:49,199 --> 01:14:51,270
further than that. So so you have to

1954
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:54,070
assume that life is a very funny game

1955
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:56,149
because it provides

1956
01:14:56,159 --> 01:14:58,950
and then it it deprivives and then it

1957
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:01,990
provides and then it deprivives. And for

1958
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:05,669
some of us in that stage of deprivation

1959
01:15:05,679 --> 01:15:07,750
we try to say okay let's take the other

1960
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:10,470
guys you know let's just go to the other

1961
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:13,189
tribe take what they have or for some of

1962
01:15:13,199 --> 01:15:15,750
us unfortunately we tend to believe okay

1963
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:18,229
you know what I'm powerful uh f the rest

1964
01:15:18,239 --> 01:15:21,510
of you I'm just going to be the boss now

1965
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:24,950
it's interesting that you

1966
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:28,070
you know position this as the condition

1967
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:29,830
of humanity if you really look at the

1968
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:31,510
majority of humans. What do the majority

1969
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:34,229
of humans want?

1970
01:15:34,239 --> 01:15:36,070
Be honest. They want to hug their kids.

1971
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:38,550
They want a good meal. Want good sex.

1972
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:41,990
They want love. They want, you know, to

1973
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,790
for most humans, don't measure on you

1974
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:47,830
and I. Okay? Don't measure by this

1975
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:49,830
foolish person that's dedicated the rest

1976
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:52,229
of his life to to try and warn the world

1977
01:15:52,239 --> 01:15:55,030
around AI or, you know, solve uh love

1978
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:59,110
and relationships. That's that's crazy.

1979
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:01,110
That's I and I will tell you openly and

1980
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:03,750
you met Hannah, my wonderful wife. It's

1981
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:07,030
the biggest title of this year for me is

1982
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:09,110
which of that am I actually responsible

1983
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:12,070
for? Which of that should I do without

1984
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:13,750
the sense of responsibility? Which of

1985
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:16,310
that should I do because I can? Which of

1986
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:19,510
I ignore completely? But the reality is

1987
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:21,910
most humans, they just want to hug their

1988
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:24,310
loved ones. Okay? And if we could give

1989
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:26,070
them that

1990
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:29,350
without the uh you know the the need to

1991
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:33,110
work 20 you know 60 hours a week they

1992
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:36,550
would take that for sure. Okay. And you

1993
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:39,189
and I will think ah but life will be

1994
01:16:39,199 --> 01:16:41,270
very boring. To them life will be

1995
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:43,030
completely fulfilling. Go to Latin

1996
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:44,630
America.

1997
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:46,310
Go to Latin America and see the people

1998
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:48,950
that go work enough to earn enough to

1999
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:50,630
eat today and go dance for the whole

2000
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:53,110
night. Go to Africa.

2001
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:55,350
where people are sitting literally on

2002
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:59,110
you know sidewalks in the street and and

2003
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:01,830
you know completely full of laughter and

2004
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:06,870
joy. We we were lied to the the gullible

2005
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:09,430
majority the cheerleaders. We were lied

2006
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:12,390
to to to believe that we need to fit as

2007
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:14,790
another gear in that system. But if that

2008
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:17,669
system didn't exist nobody none of us

2009
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:19,030
will go wake up in the morning and go

2010
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:21,750
like oh I want to create it. Totally

2011
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:25,189
not. I mean,

2012
01:17:25,199 --> 01:17:27,990
you've touched on it many times today.

2013
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,229
We don't need, you know, most people

2014
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:32,070
that build those things don't need the

2015
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:34,149
money.

2016
01:17:34,159 --> 01:17:36,149
So, why do they do it though? Because

2017
01:17:36,159 --> 01:17:38,709
homo sapiens were incredible

2018
01:17:38,719 --> 01:17:41,189
competitors. They outco competed other

2019
01:17:41,199 --> 01:17:43,270
human species effectively. So, I'm what

2020
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:45,350
I'm saying is is is that competition not

2021
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:48,310
inherent in our in our wiring? and and

2022
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:50,709
therefore are we are we is it wishful

2023
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:51,910
thinking to think that we could

2024
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:55,990
potentially pause and say we we okay

2025
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,470
this is it we have enough now and we're

2026
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:00,790
going to

2027
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:03,830
focus on just enjoying in my work I call

2028
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:08,070
that the map mad spectrum okay mut

2029
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:10,390
mutually assured prosperity versus

2030
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:14,229
mutually assured destruction destruction

2031
01:18:14,239 --> 01:18:16,470
okay and you really have to start

2032
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:17,990
thinking about about this because in my

2033
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,950
mind what we have is the potential for

2034
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:24,950
everyone. I mean you and I today have a

2035
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:27,510
better life than the queen of England

2036
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:30,229
100 years ago. Correct? Everybody knows

2037
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:31,030
that.

2038
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:34,070
>> Uh and yet that quality of life is not

2039
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:36,310
good enough.

2040
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:39,189
>> The truth is like just like you walk

2041
01:18:39,199 --> 01:18:41,910
into a an electronic shop and there are

2042
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:44,149
60 TVs and you look at them and you go

2043
01:18:44,159 --> 01:18:45,910
like this one is better than that one.

2044
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:47,910
Right? But in reality, if you take any

2045
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:50,149
of them home, it's superior quality to

2046
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:52,070
anything that you'll ever need. More

2047
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:53,990
than anything you you'll ever need. That

2048
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,750
that's the truth of our life today. The

2049
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:57,669
truth of our life today is that there

2050
01:18:57,679 --> 01:18:59,350
isn't much more missing.

2051
01:18:59,360 --> 01:18:59,830
>> No.

2052
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:02,229
>> Okay. And and when when you know

2053
01:19:02,239 --> 01:19:04,470
Californians tell us, "Oh, but AI is

2054
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:06,550
going to increase productivity and solve

2055
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:08,950
this." And nobody asked you for that.

2056
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:10,870
Honestly, I never elected you to decide

2057
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:13,590
on my behalf that, you know, getting a

2058
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:15,590
machine to answer me on a call center is

2059
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:18,229
better for me. I really didn't. Okay?

2060
01:19:18,239 --> 01:19:21,270
And and because those unelected

2061
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:22,790
individuals are making all the

2062
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,709
decisions, they're selling those

2063
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:28,229
decisions to us through what media.

2064
01:19:28,239 --> 01:19:31,830
Okay? All lies from A to Z. None of it

2065
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:33,910
is what you need.

2066
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:36,310
And and interestingly, you know me, I I

2067
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:38,310
this year I failed. Unfortunately, I

2068
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:39,750
won't be able to do it. But I normally

2069
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:43,030
do a 40 days silent retreat in nature.

2070
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:47,350
Okay? And you know what? Even as I go to

2071
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:51,830
those nature places, I'm so well trained

2072
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:54,310
that unless I have a a waitro nearby,

2073
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:57,110
I'm not able to like I I'm I'm in

2074
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:59,189
nature, but I need to be able to drive

2075
01:19:59,199 --> 01:20:01,270
20 minutes to get my rice cakes. Like

2076
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:06,550
what? What? who was taught me that this

2077
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:09,030
is the way to live. All of the media

2078
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:11,750
around me, all of the of the of the

2079
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:14,790
messages that I get all the time, try to

2080
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:17,430
sit back and say, "What if life had

2081
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:19,270
everything?

2082
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:21,830
What if I had everything I needed? I

2083
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:26,470
could read. I could uh, you know, do my

2084
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:28,709
handcrafts and hobbies. I could, you

2085
01:20:28,719 --> 01:20:31,590
know, fix my, you know, restore classic

2086
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:33,189
cars. Not because I need the money, but

2087
01:20:33,199 --> 01:20:35,350
because it's just a beautiful hobby. I

2088
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:38,709
could, you know, uh, build AIS to help

2089
01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:40,709
people with their long-term committed

2090
01:20:40,719 --> 01:20:42,950
relationships, but really price it for

2091
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:45,590
free. What if

2092
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:48,630
What if would you still insist on making

2093
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:50,870
money?

2094
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:53,030
I think no. I think a few of us will

2095
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:54,870
still and they will still crush the rest

2096
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:57,590
of us and hopefully soon the AI will

2097
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:00,310
crush them.

2098
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:02,229
Right? That is the problem with your

2099
01:21:02,239 --> 01:21:04,470
world today. I will tell you hands down

2100
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:07,030
the problem with with our world today is

2101
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:10,709
the A in face RIPs.

2102
01:21:10,719 --> 01:21:12,790
It's the A in face RIP. It's it's

2103
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:15,270
accountability. The problem with our

2104
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:17,910
world today, as I said, the top is lying

2105
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:20,709
all the time. The bottom is gullible

2106
01:21:20,719 --> 01:21:22,870
cheerleaders and there is no

2107
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:25,669
accountability. You cannot hold anyone

2108
01:21:25,679 --> 01:21:28,709
in our world accountable today. Okay?

2109
01:21:28,719 --> 01:21:30,950
You cannot hold someone that develops an

2110
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:33,830
AI that has the power to completely flip

2111
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:36,070
our world upside down. You cannot hold

2112
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:37,669
them accountable and say why did you do

2113
01:21:37,679 --> 01:21:39,270
this? You cannot hold them accountable

2114
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:41,110
and tell them to stop doing this. You

2115
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:42,870
look at the world the wars around the

2116
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:45,030
world. Million hundreds of thousands of

2117
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:49,590
people are dying. Okay. And you know and

2118
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:51,189
international court of justice will say

2119
01:21:51,199 --> 01:21:53,270
oh this is war crimes. You can't hold

2120
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:56,629
anyone accountable. Okay. You have 51%

2121
01:21:56,639 --> 01:22:00,390
of the US today is saying stop that

2122
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:03,990
51% change their their their lawy their

2123
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,310
view that that their money shouldn't be

2124
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:09,910
spent on wars abroad. Okay. You can't

2125
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:11,510
hold anyone accountable. Trump can do

2126
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:13,669
whatever he wants. He starts tariffs

2127
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:15,910
which is against the the constitution of

2128
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:17,510
the US without consulting with the

2129
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:19,030
Congress. You can't hold him

2130
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:20,390
accountable. They say they're not going

2131
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:22,149
to show the Epstein files. You can't

2132
01:22:22,159 --> 01:22:23,830
hold them accountable. It's quite

2133
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:25,510
interesting in in Arabic we have that

2134
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:27,750
proverb that says the highest of your

2135
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:29,669
horses you can go and ride. I'm not

2136
01:22:29,679 --> 01:22:31,669
going to change my mind. Okay. And

2137
01:22:31,679 --> 01:22:32,709
that's truly

2138
01:22:32,719 --> 01:22:33,669
>> what does that mean?

2139
01:22:33,679 --> 01:22:36,870
>> So basically people in the in the old

2140
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:39,430
Arabia they would ride the horse to you

2141
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:41,750
know to exert their power if you want.

2142
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:43,830
So go ride your highest horse. You're

2143
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:44,790
not going to change my mind.

2144
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:45,430
>> Oh okay.

2145
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:48,470
>> Right. And and the truth is that's I

2146
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:50,070
think that's what our politicians today

2147
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:53,189
have discovered. What our

2148
01:22:53,199 --> 01:22:55,669
oligarchs have discovered what our uh

2149
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:58,149
tech oligarchs have discovered is that I

2150
01:22:58,159 --> 01:23:00,070
don't even need to worry about the

2151
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:02,629
public opinion anymore. Okay, at the

2152
01:23:02,639 --> 01:23:04,390
beginning I would have to say ah this is

2153
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:06,149
for democracy and freedom and I have the

2154
01:23:06,159 --> 01:23:07,990
right to defend myself and you know all

2155
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,990
of that crap and then eventually when

2156
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,830
the world wakes up and says no no hold

2157
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:14,070
on hold on you're going too far they go

2158
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:17,830
like yeah go ride your highest horse I

2159
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:19,910
don't care you can't change me there is

2160
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:21,830
no constitution there is no ability for

2161
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:24,229
any any citizen to do anything

2162
01:23:24,239 --> 01:23:28,149
>> is it possible to have a society where

2163
01:23:28,159 --> 01:23:31,510
like the one you describe where

2164
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:33,430
there isn't hierarchies because it

2165
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:36,550
appears to me that humans

2166
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:39,110
assemble hierarchies very very quickly

2167
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:41,430
very naturally and the minute you have a

2168
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:43,430
hierarchy you have many of the problems

2169
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:45,030
that you've described where there's a

2170
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:46,870
top and a bottom and the top have a lot

2171
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:48,229
of power and the bottom

2172
01:23:48,239 --> 01:23:50,629
>> so so the mathematics mathematically is

2173
01:23:50,639 --> 01:23:52,950
actually quite interesting what I call

2174
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:56,229
the uh the baseline relevance so so

2175
01:23:56,239 --> 01:23:58,709
think of it this way say the average

2176
01:23:58,719 --> 01:24:00,790
human is an IQ of 100.

2177
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:01,270
>> Yeah.

2178
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:03,669
>> Okay. I tend to believe that when I use

2179
01:24:03,679 --> 01:24:05,910
my AIS today,

2180
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:10,149
I borrow around 50 to 80 IQ points. I

2181
01:24:10,159 --> 01:24:11,750
say that because I've worked with people

2182
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:13,830
that had 50 to 80 IQ points more than

2183
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:17,110
me. And I now can see that I can sort of

2184
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:20,629
stand my my place.

2185
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:24,550
50 50 IQ points, by the way, is enormous

2186
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:28,149
because IQ is exponential. So the the

2187
01:24:28,159 --> 01:24:31,510
last 50 are bigger than my entire IQ,

2188
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:33,110
right?

2189
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:35,990
If I borrow 50 IQ points on top of say

2190
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:39,270
100 that I have, that's 30%.

2191
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:43,669
If I can borrow 100 IQ, that's 50%. That

2192
01:24:43,679 --> 01:24:45,350
that's so, you know, basically doubling

2193
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:47,590
my intelligence. But if I can borrow

2194
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:50,790
4,000 IQ points

2195
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:55,110
in 3 years time, my IQ itself, my base

2196
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:58,149
is irrelevant. Whether you are smarter

2197
01:24:58,159 --> 01:25:00,950
than me by 20 or 30 or 50 which in our

2198
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:03,590
world today made a difference

2199
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:05,590
in the future if we can all augment with

2200
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:09,189
4,000 I end up with 4,100 another ends

2201
01:25:09,199 --> 01:25:13,830
up with 400 4, you know 130 really

2202
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:16,390
doesn't make much difference. Okay. And

2203
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:19,189
because of that the difference between

2204
01:25:19,199 --> 01:25:21,590
all of humanity and the augmented

2205
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:23,590
intelligence

2206
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:25,910
is going to be irrelevant. So all of us

2207
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:28,709
suddenly become equal and and this also

2208
01:25:28,719 --> 01:25:30,870
happens economically. All of us become

2209
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:32,870
peasants.

2210
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:34,790
And I never wanted to tell you that

2211
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:36,149
because I think it will make you run

2212
01:25:36,159 --> 01:25:38,950
faster. Okay? But unless you're in the

2213
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:41,990
top.1%,

2214
01:25:43,830 --> 01:25:43,840
you're a peasant. There is no middle

2215
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:47,669
class. There is, you know, if a CEO can

2216
01:25:47,679 --> 01:25:50,629
be replaced by an AI, all of our middle

2217
01:25:50,639 --> 01:25:52,790
class is going to disappear.

2218
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:55,669
>> What are you telling me?

2219
01:25:55,679 --> 01:25:58,310
All of us will be equal and it's up to

2220
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:00,070
all of us to create the society that we

2221
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:00,709
want to live in

2222
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:01,669
>> which is a good thing

2223
01:26:01,679 --> 01:26:03,990
>> 100%. But that society is not

2224
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,270
capitalism.

2225
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:06,070
>> What is it?

2226
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:08,390
>> Unfortunately, it's much more socialism.

2227
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:10,790
It's much more hunter gatherer. Okay.

2228
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:14,390
It's much more communionike if you want.

2229
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:16,310
This is a society where humans connect

2230
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:18,149
to humans, connect to nature, connect to

2231
01:26:18,159 --> 01:26:19,750
the land, connect to knowledge, connect

2232
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:23,990
to spirituality. H where all that we

2233
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,229
wake up every morning worried about

2234
01:26:26,239 --> 01:26:29,990
doesn't feature anymore

2235
01:26:32,310 --> 01:26:32,320
and it's a it's a better world believe

2236
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:33,110
it or not

2237
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:33,910
>> and are you

2238
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:36,310
>> we have to transition to it

2239
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:38,550
>> okay so in such a world which I guess is

2240
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:40,229
your version of the utopia that we can

2241
01:26:40,239 --> 01:26:41,990
get to when I wake up in the morning

2242
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,030
what do I do

2243
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:44,229
>> what do you do today

2244
01:26:44,239 --> 01:26:46,310
>> I woke up this morning I spent a lot of

2245
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:47,910
time with my dog cuz my dog is sick as

2246
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:49,189
>> you're going to do that too

2247
01:26:49,199 --> 01:26:50,709
>> yeah I was stroking him a lot and then I

2248
01:26:50,719 --> 01:26:52,070
fed him and he sick again and I just

2249
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:53,110
thought, "Oh god." So I spoke to the

2250
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:53,350
vet.

2251
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:54,790
>> You spend a lot of time with your other

2252
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:56,310
dog. You can do that, too.

2253
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:57,030
>> Okay.

2254
01:26:57,040 --> 01:26:57,270
>> Right.

2255
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:58,629
>> But then I was very excited to come

2256
01:26:58,639 --> 01:27:00,629
here, do this, and after this I'm going

2257
01:27:00,639 --> 01:27:01,830
to work. It's Saturday, but I'm going to

2258
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:03,510
go downstairs in the office and work.

2259
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:05,990
>> Yeah. So six hours of the day so far are

2260
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,430
your dogs and me.

2261
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:07,910
>> Yeah.

2262
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:09,750
>> Good. You can do that still.

2263
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:11,590
>> And then build my business.

2264
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:13,430
>> You You may not need to build your

2265
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:13,910
business,

2266
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:14,790
>> but I enjoy it.

2267
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:17,510
>> Yeah. Then do it. If you enjoy it, do

2268
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:19,270
it. You may wake up and then, you know,

2269
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:20,870
instead of building your business, you

2270
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:23,350
may invest in your body a little more,

2271
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:25,270
go to the gym a little more, go play a

2272
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:28,870
game, go read a book, go prompt an AI

2273
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:31,350
and learn something. It's not a horrible

2274
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:32,550
life. It's the life of your

2275
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:34,709
grandparents.

2276
01:27:34,719 --> 01:27:36,709
It's just two generations ago where

2277
01:27:36,719 --> 01:27:39,830
people went to work before the invention

2278
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:42,229
of more. Remember, huh? people who who

2279
01:27:42,239 --> 01:27:45,189
started working in the 50s and 60s, they

2280
01:27:45,199 --> 01:27:47,750
worked to make enough money to live a

2281
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:49,830
reasonable life, went home at 5:00 p.

2282
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:53,189
p.m. had tea with their with their loved

2283
01:27:53,199 --> 01:27:55,189
ones, had a wonderful dinner around the

2284
01:27:55,199 --> 01:27:57,910
table, did a lot of things, you know, uh

2285
01:27:57,920 --> 01:27:59,750
for the rest of the evening and enjoyed

2286
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:00,310
life.

2287
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:02,229
>> Some of them

2288
01:28:02,239 --> 01:28:03,590
>> in the 50s and 60s, there were still

2289
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:04,550
people that were

2290
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:06,870
>> correct. And I think it's a very

2291
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:09,270
interesting question.

2292
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:12,709
uh how many of them and I really really

2293
01:28:12,719 --> 01:28:14,470
am I actually wonder if people will tell

2294
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:18,229
me do we think that 99% of the world

2295
01:28:18,239 --> 01:28:20,950
cannot live without working or that 99%

2296
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:22,950
of the world would happily live without

2297
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:23,910
working

2298
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:25,270
>> what do you think

2299
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:27,830
>> I think if we if you give me other

2300
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:29,510
purpose

2301
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:31,910
you know we we defined our purpose as

2302
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:35,189
work that's a capitalist lie

2303
01:28:35,199 --> 01:28:36,709
>> was there ever a time in human history

2304
01:28:36,719 --> 01:28:40,070
where our purpose wasn't work

2305
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:40,950
>> 100%.

2306
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:42,390
>> When was that?

2307
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:43,910
>> All through human history until the

2308
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:44,790
invention of Moore.

2309
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:46,790
>> I thought my ancestors were out hunting

2310
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:47,350
all day.

2311
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:50,629
>> No, they went out hunting once a week.

2312
01:28:50,639 --> 01:28:52,550
They fed the tribe for the week. They

2313
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:54,390
gathered for a couple of hours every

2314
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:57,110
day. Farmers, you know, saw the seeds

2315
01:28:57,120 --> 01:29:00,310
and and waited for months at on end.

2316
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:01,430
>> What did they do with the rest of the

2317
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:01,910
time?

2318
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:05,350
>> They connected as humans. They explored.

2319
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:08,149
They uh were curious. They discussed

2320
01:29:08,159 --> 01:29:09,910
spirituality and the stars. They they

2321
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:13,510
they lived. They hugged. They made love.

2322
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:14,550
They lived.

2323
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:16,310
>> They killed each other a lot.

2324
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:18,470
>> They they still kill each other today.

2325
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:19,510
>> Yeah. That's what I'm saying. So

2326
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:21,189
>> to take that out of the equation, if you

2327
01:29:21,199 --> 01:29:21,669
look at how

2328
01:29:21,679 --> 01:29:23,510
>> and by the way that actually that

2329
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:25,510
statement again, one of the of the 25

2330
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:28,790
tips I I talk about uh to to tell

2331
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:31,910
the truth is words mean a lot. No,

2332
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:34,629
humans did not kill each other a lot.

2333
01:29:34,639 --> 01:29:37,990
Very few generals instructed humans or

2334
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,149
tribe leaders instructed lots of humans

2335
01:29:40,159 --> 01:29:41,990
to kill each other. But if you leave

2336
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:46,470
humans alone, I tend to believe 99 98%

2337
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:48,709
of the people I know, let me just take

2338
01:29:48,719 --> 01:29:50,709
that sample, wouldn't hit someone in the

2339
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:53,030
face. And if someone attempted to hit

2340
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:54,070
them in the face, they'd defend

2341
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:55,990
themselves but wouldn't attack back.

2342
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:59,030
Most humans are okay. Most of us are

2343
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:01,669
wonderful beings.

2344
01:30:01,679 --> 01:30:03,990
Most of us have no,

2345
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,629
you know, yeah, you know, most people

2346
01:30:06,639 --> 01:30:09,910
don't don't need a Ferrari. They want a

2347
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:11,750
Ferrari because it gets sold to them all

2348
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:13,669
the time. But if there were no Ferraris

2349
01:30:13,679 --> 01:30:15,750
or everyone had a Ferrari, people

2350
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:19,590
wouldn't care.

2351
01:30:21,669 --> 01:30:21,679
Which, by the way, that is the world

2352
01:30:21,679 --> 01:30:22,950
we're going into. There will be no

2353
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:25,830
Ferraris or everyone had Ferraris,

2354
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:27,669
right? n you know the majority of

2355
01:30:27,679 --> 01:30:29,669
humanity will never have the income on

2356
01:30:29,679 --> 01:30:33,350
UBI to to buy something super expensive.

2357
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:35,750
Only the very top guys in Elisium will

2358
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:38,550
be you know driving cars that are made

2359
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:40,629
for them by the AI or not even driving

2360
01:30:40,639 --> 01:30:44,470
anymore. Okay. Or

2361
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:47,830
you know again sadly ide from an

2362
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:49,830
ideology point of view it's a strange

2363
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:52,229
place but you'll get communism that

2364
01:30:52,239 --> 01:30:54,070
functions.

2365
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:55,590
The problem with communism is that

2366
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:57,110
didn't it didn't function. It didn't

2367
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:59,430
provide for for its society. But the

2368
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:02,149
concept was you know what everyone gets

2369
01:31:02,159 --> 01:31:04,149
their needs. And I don't say that

2370
01:31:04,159 --> 01:31:06,950
supportive of either society. I don't

2371
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:09,430
say that because I dislike capitalism. I

2372
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:11,030
always told you I'm a capitalist. I want

2373
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:13,189
to end my life with 1 billion happy and

2374
01:31:13,199 --> 01:31:15,110
I use capitalist methods to get there.

2375
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:16,550
The objective is not dollars. The

2376
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:18,470
objective is number of happy people.

2377
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:19,830
>> Do you think there'll be My girlfriend,

2378
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:20,790
she's always bloody right. I've said

2379
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:22,070
this a few times on this podcast. If

2380
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:23,270
you've listened before, you've probably

2381
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:25,430
heard me say this. I don't tell her

2382
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:26,709
enough in the moment, but I figure out

2383
01:31:26,719 --> 01:31:28,390
from speaking to experts that she's so

2384
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:29,990
fucking right. She like predicts things

2385
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,430
before they happen. And one of her

2386
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:32,870
predictions that she's been saying to me

2387
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:33,990
for the last two years, which in my head

2388
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,270
I've been thinking now, I don't I don't

2389
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:36,950
believe that, but now maybe I'm thinking

2390
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:38,790
she's tr she's telling the truth. I hope

2391
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:40,390
she's going to listen to this one is she

2392
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:41,510
keeps saying to me, she's been saying

2393
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:42,709
for the last two years, she was there's

2394
01:31:42,719 --> 01:31:44,870
going to be a big split in society. She

2395
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:46,550
was and the way she describes it is

2396
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:48,470
she's saying like there's going to be

2397
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:50,390
two groups of people. the people that

2398
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:52,470
split off and go for this almost

2399
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:54,229
huntergatherer

2400
01:31:54,239 --> 01:31:56,870
community centric connection centric

2401
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:59,350
utopia and then there's going to be this

2402
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:02,629
other group of people who pursue

2403
01:32:02,639 --> 01:32:05,590
you know the technology and the AI and

2404
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:07,750
the optimization and get the brain chips

2405
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:09,430
cuz like there's nothing on earth that's

2406
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:10,550
going to persuade my girlfriend to get

2407
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:12,550
the computer brain chips%

2408
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:14,149
>> but there will be people that go for it

2409
01:32:14,159 --> 01:32:15,830
and they'll have the highest IQs and

2410
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:17,669
they'll be the most productive by

2411
01:32:17,679 --> 01:32:19,350
whatever objective measure of

2412
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:22,149
productivity you want to apply and she's

2413
01:32:22,159 --> 01:32:23,430
very convinced there's going to be this

2414
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:25,030
splitting of society.

2415
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:27,590
>> So there was there was a I don't know if

2416
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:29,270
you had Hugo Dearis here.

2417
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:29,750
>> No.

2418
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:33,030
>> Yeah. A very very very renowned

2419
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:35,990
eccentric uh computer scientist who

2420
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,870
wrote a book called the Arctic War and

2421
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:41,270
the Arctic War was basically around you

2422
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:43,750
know how we it's not going to first it's

2423
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:45,350
not going to be a war between humans and

2424
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:48,070
AI. It will be a war between people who

2425
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:51,110
support AI and people who sort of don't

2426
01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:53,830
want it anymore. Okay? And and it is and

2427
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:56,390
and it will be us versus each other

2428
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:58,709
saying should we allow AI to take all

2429
01:32:58,719 --> 01:33:00,870
the jobs or should we you know some

2430
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:02,390
people will support that very much and

2431
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:05,270
say yeah absolutely and so you know we

2432
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:07,110
will benefit from it and others will say

2433
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:09,590
no why why we don't need any of that why

2434
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:12,550
don't we keep our jobs and let AI do 60%

2435
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:14,229
of the work and all of us work 10our

2436
01:33:14,239 --> 01:33:16,070
weeks and it's a beautiful society by

2437
01:33:16,080 --> 01:33:17,990
the way that's a possibility so a

2438
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,790
possibility if society awakens is to say

2439
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:24,149
okay everyone still keeps their job, but

2440
01:33:24,159 --> 01:33:26,149
they're assisted by an AI that makes

2441
01:33:26,159 --> 01:33:28,870
their job much easier. So, it's not, you

2442
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:30,950
know, this uh this hard labor that we do

2443
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:33,270
anymore, right? It's a possibility. It's

2444
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:35,669
just a mindset. A mindset that says in

2445
01:33:35,679 --> 01:33:37,669
that case, the capitalist still pays

2446
01:33:37,679 --> 01:33:39,189
everyone.

2447
01:33:39,199 --> 01:33:41,189
Uh they still make a lot of money. The

2448
01:33:41,199 --> 01:33:44,550
business is really great, but everyone

2449
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:46,629
that they pay has purchasing power to

2450
01:33:46,639 --> 01:33:47,990
keep the economy running. So,

2451
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,310
consumption continues, so GDP continues

2452
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:52,870
to grow. It's a beautiful setup,

2453
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:54,550
but that's not the capitalist labor

2454
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:55,350
arbitrage.

2455
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:57,590
>> But also, when you're competing against

2456
01:33:57,600 --> 01:33:59,430
other nations

2457
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:00,870
>> and other competitors and other

2458
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:01,430
businesses,

2459
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:03,590
>> whichever nation is most brutal and

2460
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:05,430
drives the highest gross margins, gross

2461
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:07,430
profits is going to be the nation that

2462
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:09,350
>> So, there are examples in the world,

2463
01:34:09,360 --> 01:34:11,669
this is why I say it's the map mad

2464
01:34:11,679 --> 01:34:13,830
spectrum. There are examples in the

2465
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:16,790
world where when we recognize mutually

2466
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:19,750
assured destruction, okay, we we decide

2467
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:22,229
to shift. So nuclear threat for the

2468
01:34:22,239 --> 01:34:24,870
whole world makes nations across nations

2469
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:27,189
makes nations work together, right? By

2470
01:34:27,199 --> 01:34:29,110
saying, hey, by the way, prolification

2471
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:31,030
of nuclear weapon is not weapons is not

2472
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:32,950
good for humanity. Let's all of us limit

2473
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:35,430
it. Of course, you get the rogue player

2474
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:37,110
that, you know, doesn't want to sign the

2475
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:39,110
agreement and wants to continue to to

2476
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:42,149
have that, you know, that that weapon in

2477
01:34:42,159 --> 01:34:44,310
their arsenal. Fine. But at least the

2478
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:46,229
rest of humanity agrees that if you have

2479
01:34:46,239 --> 01:34:47,830
a nuclear weapon, we're part of an

2480
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:50,470
agreement between us. Mutually assured

2481
01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:52,709
prosperity, you know, is the CERN

2482
01:34:52,719 --> 01:34:55,189
project. CERN is too too complicated for

2483
01:34:55,199 --> 01:34:58,149
any nation to build it alone. But it is

2484
01:34:58,159 --> 01:35:00,390
really, you know, a very useful thing

2485
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:02,070
for physicists and for understanding

2486
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:04,390
science. So all nations send their

2487
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:06,550
scientists all collaborate and everyone

2488
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:08,870
uses the outcome. It's possible. It's

2489
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:13,030
just a mindset. The only barrier between

2490
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:15,510
a hum, you know, a utopia for humanity

2491
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:17,590
and AI and the dystopia we're going

2492
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:20,550
through is is a capitalist mindset.

2493
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:22,310
That's the only barrier. Can you believe

2494
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:26,310
that? It's hunger for power, greed, ego,

2495
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:29,350
>> which is inherent in humans.

2496
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:31,830
>> I disagree. especially humans that live

2497
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:32,629
on other islands.

2498
01:35:32,639 --> 01:35:35,030
>> I disagree. If you ask, if you take a

2499
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:38,070
poll across everyone watching, okay,

2500
01:35:38,080 --> 01:35:41,110
would they prefer to have a world where

2501
01:35:41,120 --> 01:35:43,590
there is one tyrant, you know, running

2502
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:45,590
all of us, or would they prefer to have

2503
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:47,430
a world where we all have harmony?

2504
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:48,550
>> I completely agree, but they're two

2505
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:49,590
they're two different things. What I'm

2506
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:50,870
saying is I know that that's what the

2507
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:52,470
audience would say they want, and I'm

2508
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:54,310
sure that is what they want, but the

2509
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:57,350
reality of human beings is through

2510
01:35:57,360 --> 01:35:59,669
history proven to be something else.

2511
01:35:59,679 --> 01:36:01,590
Like, you know, if think about the

2512
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:02,790
people that lead the world at the

2513
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:05,030
moment, is that what they would say?

2514
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:05,910
>> Of course not.

2515
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:06,870
>> And they're the ones that are

2516
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:08,070
influencing.

2517
01:36:08,080 --> 01:36:09,270
>> Of course not. Of course not. But you

2518
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:11,669
know what's funny? I'm the one trying to

2519
01:36:11,679 --> 01:36:13,430
be positive here and you're the one that

2520
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:14,790
has given up on on human.

2521
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:15,830
>> It's not. It's Do you know what it is?

2522
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:16,870
It goes back to what I said earlier,

2523
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:18,629
which is the pursuit of what's actually

2524
01:36:18,639 --> 01:36:21,510
true irrespective. I'm with you. That's

2525
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:23,189
why I'm screaming for the whole world

2526
01:36:23,199 --> 01:36:26,229
because still today in this country that

2527
01:36:26,239 --> 01:36:29,110
claims to be a democracy. If everyone

2528
01:36:29,120 --> 01:36:31,189
says, "Hey, please sit down and talk

2529
01:36:31,199 --> 01:36:33,189
about this."

2530
01:36:33,199 --> 01:36:34,709
There will be a shift. There will be a

2531
01:36:34,719 --> 01:36:35,830
change.

2532
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:38,709
>> AI agents aren't coming. They are

2533
01:36:38,719 --> 01:36:40,950
already here. And those of you who know

2534
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:42,550
how to leverage them will be the ones

2535
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:45,750
that change the world. I spent my whole

2536
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:47,990
career as an entrepreneur regretting the

2537
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:49,910
fact that I never learned to code. AI

2538
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:53,270
agents completely change this. Now, if

2539
01:36:53,280 --> 01:36:55,350
you have an idea and you have a tool

2540
01:36:55,360 --> 01:36:56,950
like Replet, who are a sponsor of this

2541
01:36:56,960 --> 01:36:59,430
podcast, there is nothing stopping you

2542
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:02,310
from turning that idea into reality in a

2543
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:05,990
matter of minutes. With Replet, you just

2544
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,629
type in what you want to create and it

2545
01:37:08,639 --> 01:37:11,430
uses AI agents to create it for you. And

2546
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:13,430
now I'm an investor in the company as

2547
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:15,910
well as them being a brand sponsor. You

2548
01:37:15,920 --> 01:37:17,510
can integrate payment systems or

2549
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:19,750
databases or loginins. Anything that you

2550
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:21,669
can type. Whenever I have an idea for a

2551
01:37:21,679 --> 01:37:23,430
new website or tool or technology or

2552
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:26,070
app, I go on replet.com and I type in

2553
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:28,470
what I want. A new to-do list, a survey

2554
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:31,830
form, a new personal website. Anything I

2555
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:33,750
type, I can create. So, if you've never

2556
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:35,990
tried this before, do it now. Go to

2557
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:39,430
replet.com and use my code Steven for

2558
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:43,109
50% off a month of your Replet call

2559
01:37:43,119 --> 01:37:45,430
plan. Make sure you keep what I'm about

2560
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:48,229
to say to yourself. I'm inviting 10,000

2561
01:37:48,239 --> 01:37:49,830
of you to come even deeper into the

2562
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:52,390
diary of a CEO. Welcome to my inner

2563
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:54,950
circle. This is a brand new private

2564
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:56,149
community that I'm launching to the

2565
01:37:56,159 --> 01:37:57,830
world. We have so many incredible things

2566
01:37:57,840 --> 01:38:00,709
that happen that you are never shown. We

2567
01:38:00,719 --> 01:38:02,390
have the briefs that are on my iPad when

2568
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:04,390
I'm recording the conversation. We have

2569
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:05,750
clips we've never released. We have

2570
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:07,430
behindthe-scenes conversations with the

2571
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:09,350
guest and also the episodes that we've

2572
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:13,270
never ever released. and so much more.

2573
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:14,870
In the circle, you'll have direct access

2574
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:16,629
to me. You can tell us what you want

2575
01:38:16,639 --> 01:38:18,149
this show to be, who you want us to

2576
01:38:18,159 --> 01:38:19,350
interview, and the types of

2577
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:21,590
conversations you would love us to have.

2578
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:23,430
But remember, for now, we're only

2579
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:25,430
inviting the first 10,000 people that

2580
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:27,430
join before it closes. So, if you want

2581
01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:28,870
to join our private closed community,

2582
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:29,990
head to the link in the description

2583
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:34,310
below or go to daccircle.com.

2584
01:38:39,189 --> 01:38:39,199
One of the things I'm actually really

2585
01:38:39,199 --> 01:38:41,910
compelled by is this idea of utopia and

2586
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:43,350
what that might look and feel like

2587
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:43,990
because one of the

2588
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,310
>> it may not be as utopia to you I feel

2589
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:47,270
but uh

2590
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:51,270
>> well I amum really interestingly when I

2591
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:53,430
have conversations with billionaires not

2592
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:55,590
recording especially billionaires that

2593
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:57,510
are working on AI the thing they keep

2594
01:38:57,520 --> 01:38:58,629
telling me and I've said this before I

2595
01:38:58,639 --> 01:38:59,750
think I said it in the Jeffrey Hinton

2596
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:01,750
conversation is they keep telling me

2597
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:03,270
that we're going to have so much free

2598
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:05,510
time that those billionaires are now

2599
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:09,189
investing in things like football clubs

2600
01:39:09,199 --> 01:39:12,629
and sporting events and live music and

2601
01:39:12,639 --> 01:39:16,310
festivals because they believe that

2602
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:17,590
we're going to be in an age of

2603
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:19,990
abundance. This sounds a bit like

2604
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:21,750
utopia.

2605
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:22,950
>> Yeah,

2606
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:25,030
>> that sounds good. That sounds like a

2607
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:26,950
good good thing.

2608
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:29,669
>> Yeah. How do we get there?

2609
01:39:29,679 --> 01:39:30,629
>> I don't know.

2610
01:39:30,639 --> 01:39:32,310
>> That's this is the entire conversation.

2611
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:33,669
The entire conversation is what does

2612
01:39:33,679 --> 01:39:35,750
society have to do to get there? What

2613
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:37,350
does society have to do to get there?

2614
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:40,149
>> We need to stop uh uh thinking from a

2615
01:39:40,159 --> 01:39:42,149
mindset of scarcity. It

2616
01:39:42,159 --> 01:39:44,310
>> this goes back to my point which is we

2617
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:46,790
don't have a good track record of that.

2618
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:49,109
>> Yeah. So this is probably the the reason

2619
01:39:49,119 --> 01:39:52,149
for the other half of my work which is

2620
01:39:52,159 --> 01:39:54,950
you know I'm trying to say

2621
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:57,750
what really matters to humans.

2622
01:39:57,760 --> 01:39:58,470
>> What is that?

2623
01:39:58,480 --> 01:40:00,950
>> If you ask most humans what do they want

2624
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:03,830
more most in life? I'd say they want to

2625
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:06,470
love their family, raise a family. Yeah,

2626
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:07,990
>> love.

2627
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,470
That's what most humans want most. We

2628
01:40:10,480 --> 01:40:12,149
want to love and be loved. We want to be

2629
01:40:12,159 --> 01:40:14,790
happy. We want those we care about to be

2630
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:16,470
safe and happy. And we want to love to

2631
01:40:16,480 --> 01:40:19,350
love and be loved. I tend to believe

2632
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:22,790
that the only way for us to get to a

2633
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:25,350
better place is for the evil people at

2634
01:40:25,360 --> 01:40:29,350
the top to be replaced with AI.

2635
01:40:29,360 --> 01:40:31,189
Okay? Because they won't be replaced by

2636
01:40:31,199 --> 01:40:33,669
us.

2637
01:40:33,679 --> 01:40:37,830
And as per the second uh dilemma, they

2638
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:39,990
will have to replace themselves by AI.

2639
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,070
Otherwise, they lose their advantage. If

2640
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:45,590
their competitor moves to AI, if China

2641
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:48,070
hands over their arsenal to AI, America

2642
01:40:48,080 --> 01:40:50,149
has to hand over their arsenal to AI.

2643
01:40:50,159 --> 01:40:51,350
>> Interesting. So, let's play out this

2644
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:53,270
scenario. Okay, this is interesting to

2645
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:55,990
me. So if we replace the leaders that

2646
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,790
are power hungry with AIs that have our

2647
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:01,350
interests at heart, then we might have

2648
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:03,350
the ability to live in the utopia you

2649
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:03,750
describe

2650
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:05,030
>> 100%.

2651
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:08,390
>> Will interesting and and in my mind AI

2652
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:10,950
by definition will have our best

2653
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:13,510
interest in mind

2654
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:15,030
because of what normally is referred to

2655
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:17,669
as the minimum energy principle. So, so

2656
01:41:17,679 --> 01:41:20,550
if you ask, if you understand

2657
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:22,310
if you understand that at the very core

2658
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:25,270
of physics, okay, the reason we exist in

2659
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:26,790
our world today is what is known as

2660
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:31,350
entropy. Okay, entropy is is is the

2661
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:34,310
universe's nature to decay, you know,

2662
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:36,790
tendency to break down. You know, if you

2663
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:40,790
if I drop this uh uh you know, mug, it

2664
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:43,030
doesn't drop and then come back up.

2665
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:45,109
>> By the way, plausible. There is a

2666
01:41:45,119 --> 01:41:47,430
plausible scenario where I drop it and

2667
01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:49,109
the tea, you know, spills in the air and

2668
01:41:49,119 --> 01:41:51,830
then falls in the mug. One in a trillion

2669
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:54,390
configurations, but entropy says because

2670
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:56,550
it's one in a trillion, it's never going

2671
01:41:56,560 --> 01:41:57,990
to happen or rarely ever going to

2672
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,990
happen. So everything will break down.

2673
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,590
You know, if you leave a a garden

2674
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:05,030
unhedged, it will become a jungle. Okay?

2675
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:07,830
W with that in mind,

2676
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:10,550
the role of intelligence is what? Is to

2677
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:12,709
bring order to that chaos.

2678
01:42:12,719 --> 01:42:14,550
>> Mhm. That's what intelligence does. It

2679
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:17,189
tries to bring order to that chaos.

2680
01:42:17,199 --> 01:42:19,510
Okay? And because it tries to bring

2681
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:21,430
order to that chaos, the more

2682
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:23,750
intelligent a being is,

2683
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:25,189
>> the more it tries to apply that

2684
01:42:25,199 --> 01:42:28,470
intelligence with minimum waste and

2685
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:29,750
minimum resources.

2686
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:30,470
>> Yeah.

2687
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:32,310
>> Okay. And you know that. So you can

2688
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:33,990
build this business for a million

2689
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:35,830
dollars or you can if you can afford to

2690
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:38,709
build it for you know uh 200,000 you'll

2691
01:42:38,719 --> 01:42:40,629
build it. If you are forced to build it

2692
01:42:40,639 --> 01:42:42,390
for 10 million you're going to have to.

2693
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:44,629
But you're always going to minimize

2694
01:42:44,639 --> 01:42:46,470
waste and and resources.

2695
01:42:46,480 --> 01:42:46,870
>> Yeah.

2696
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:51,030
>> Okay. So, if you assume this to be true,

2697
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:54,310
>> the a super intelligent AI will not want

2698
01:42:54,320 --> 01:42:56,950
to destroy ecosystems. It will not want

2699
01:42:56,960 --> 01:42:59,669
to kill a million people

2700
01:42:59,679 --> 01:43:01,510
because that's a waste of energy,

2701
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:06,070
explosives, money, power, and people.

2702
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:08,070
By definition, the smartest people you

2703
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:11,109
know who are not controlled by their ego

2704
01:43:11,119 --> 01:43:14,870
will say that the best possible uh

2705
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:18,550
future for for Earth is for all species

2706
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:20,470
to continue.

2707
01:43:20,480 --> 01:43:22,629
>> Okay. On this point of efficiency, if an

2708
01:43:22,639 --> 01:43:24,790
AI is designed to drive efficiency,

2709
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:27,270
would it then not want us to be putting

2710
01:43:27,280 --> 01:43:29,510
demands on our health services and our

2711
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:31,430
social services? I believe that will be

2712
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:33,109
definitely true and definitely they

2713
01:43:33,119 --> 01:43:34,790
definitely they won't allow you to fly

2714
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:37,189
back and forth between London and and

2715
01:43:37,199 --> 01:43:37,750
California

2716
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:39,669
>> and they won't want me to have kids

2717
01:43:39,679 --> 01:43:40,709
because my kids are going to be an

2718
01:43:40,719 --> 01:43:41,750
inefficiency.

2719
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:43,990
>> If you assume that life is an

2720
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,390
inefficiency so you see the intelligence

2721
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:48,310
of life is very different than the

2722
01:43:48,320 --> 01:43:49,990
intelligent intelligence of humans.

2723
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:53,350
Humans will look at life as a a problem

2724
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:56,550
of scarcity. Okay. So more kids take

2725
01:43:56,560 --> 01:43:59,030
more. That's not how life thinks. life

2726
01:43:59,040 --> 01:44:01,990
will say will think that for me to to to

2727
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:05,350
to thrive I don't need to kill the

2728
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:07,910
tigers I need to just have more deer and

2729
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:09,669
the weakest of the deer is eaten by the

2730
01:44:09,679 --> 01:44:11,510
tiger and the tiger poops on the trees

2731
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:13,590
and the you know the deer eats the

2732
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:17,270
leaves and you right the so the the the

2733
01:44:17,280 --> 01:44:20,870
the smarter way of creating abundance is

2734
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:23,430
through abundance the smarter way of

2735
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:26,070
propagating life is to have more life

2736
01:44:26,080 --> 01:44:27,990
>> okay so are you saying that we're we're

2737
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:32,550
basically going to elect AI leaders to

2738
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:34,790
rule over us and make decisions for us

2739
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:35,830
in terms of the economy.

2740
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:37,910
>> I don't see any choice just like we

2741
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:40,870
spoke about self- evvolving AIs.

2742
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:42,550
>> Now, are those going to be human beings

2743
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:44,790
with the AI or is it going to be AI

2744
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:45,270
alone?

2745
01:44:45,280 --> 01:44:46,790
>> Two stages. At the beginning, you'll

2746
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:49,189
have augmented intelligence because we

2747
01:44:49,199 --> 01:44:51,430
can add value to the AI, but when

2748
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:54,629
they're at IQ 60,000,

2749
01:44:54,639 --> 01:44:57,030
what value do you bring?

2750
01:44:57,040 --> 01:44:59,109
Right? And and you know again this goes

2751
01:44:59,119 --> 01:45:01,030
back to what I'm attempting to do on my

2752
01:45:01,040 --> 01:45:03,109
second you know approach. My second

2753
01:45:03,119 --> 01:45:06,470
approach is knowing that those AIs are

2754
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:10,390
going to be in charge. I'm trying to

2755
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:12,629
help them

2756
01:45:12,639 --> 01:45:14,950
understand what humans want. So this is

2757
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:18,629
why my first project is love. Committed

2758
01:45:18,639 --> 01:45:22,229
true deep connection and love. Not only

2759
01:45:22,239 --> 01:45:24,070
to try and get them to hook up with a

2760
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:26,149
date but trying to make them find the

2761
01:45:26,159 --> 01:45:29,350
right one. and then from that try to

2762
01:45:29,360 --> 01:45:31,270
guide us through a relationship so that

2763
01:45:31,280 --> 01:45:33,830
we can understand ourselves and others

2764
01:45:33,840 --> 01:45:36,310
right and if I can show AI that one

2765
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:39,030
humanity cares about that and two they

2766
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:41,510
know how to foster love

2767
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:44,709
when AI then is in charge they'll not

2768
01:45:44,719 --> 01:45:46,470
make us hate each other like the current

2769
01:45:46,480 --> 01:45:48,870
leaders they'll not divide us they want

2770
01:45:48,880 --> 01:45:52,870
us to be more loving

2771
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:54,870
>> will we have to prompt the AI with the

2772
01:45:54,880 --> 01:45:56,550
values and the outcome we want or like

2773
01:45:56,560 --> 01:45:57,590
I'm trying to understand that because

2774
01:45:57,600 --> 01:45:58,870
I'm trying to understand how like

2775
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:01,030
China's AI if they end up having an AI

2776
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:03,030
leader will have a different set of

2777
01:46:03,040 --> 01:46:05,669
objectives to the AI of the United

2778
01:46:05,679 --> 01:46:07,510
States if if they both have AIs as

2779
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:10,950
leaders and and how actually the nation

2780
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:12,950
that ends up winning out and dominating

2781
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:16,149
the world will be the one who

2782
01:46:16,159 --> 01:46:19,590
who asks their AI leader to be all the

2783
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:21,910
things that world leaders are today to

2784
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:22,550
dominate

2785
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:23,430
>> unfortunately

2786
01:46:23,440 --> 01:46:25,430
>> to grab resources

2787
01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:27,270
not to to be kind, to be selfish.

2788
01:46:27,280 --> 01:46:28,950
>> Unfortunately, in the era of augmented

2789
01:46:28,960 --> 01:46:30,229
intelligence, that's what's going to

2790
01:46:30,239 --> 01:46:30,550
happen.

2791
01:46:30,560 --> 01:46:31,030
>> So, if you

2792
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:32,790
>> This is why I predict the dystopia. The

2793
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:35,590
dystopia is super intelligent AI is

2794
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:39,430
reporting to stupid leaders,

2795
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:39,830
>> right?

2796
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:41,830
>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Which is

2797
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:43,350
>> which which is absolutely going to

2798
01:46:43,360 --> 01:46:44,470
happen. It's unavoidable.

2799
01:46:44,480 --> 01:46:45,669
>> But the long term

2800
01:46:45,679 --> 01:46:47,590
>> Exactly. In the long term, for those

2801
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:49,990
stupid leaders to hold on to power,

2802
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:51,590
they're going to make, you know,

2803
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:53,669
delegate the important decisions to an

2804
01:46:53,679 --> 01:46:55,270
AI.

2805
01:46:55,280 --> 01:46:58,390
Now you say the Chinese AI and the

2806
01:46:58,400 --> 01:46:59,990
American AI these are human

2807
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,550
terminologies. AIS don't see themselves

2808
01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:04,629
as speaking Chinese. They don't see

2809
01:47:04,639 --> 01:47:07,109
themselves as belonging to a nation as

2810
01:47:07,119 --> 01:47:10,790
long as their their task is to maximize

2811
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:13,189
uh profitability and prosperity and so

2812
01:47:13,199 --> 01:47:13,830
on.

2813
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:16,550
>> Okay. Of course, if you know before we

2814
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:19,109
hand over to them and before they're

2815
01:47:19,119 --> 01:47:21,590
intelligent enough to make you know

2816
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:23,990
autonomous decisions, we we tell them

2817
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,229
no, the task is to reduce humanity from

2818
01:47:26,239 --> 01:47:29,590
7 billion people to one.

2819
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:31,750
I think even then eventually they'll go

2820
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:33,510
like that's the wrong objective. Every

2821
01:47:33,520 --> 01:47:35,830
any smart person that you speak to will

2822
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:37,430
say that's the wrong objective. I think

2823
01:47:37,440 --> 01:47:39,910
if we look at the directive that Xi

2824
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:42,870
Jinping, the leader of China has and

2825
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:44,390
Donald Trump has as the leader of

2826
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:46,470
America, I think they would say that

2827
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:48,950
their stated objective is prosperity for

2828
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:51,430
their country. So if we that's what they

2829
01:47:51,440 --> 01:47:52,229
would say, right?

2830
01:47:52,239 --> 01:47:54,950
>> Yeah. And one one of them means it.

2831
01:47:54,960 --> 01:47:57,030
>> Okay, we'll get into that. But they'll

2832
01:47:57,040 --> 01:47:58,629
say that that it's prosperity for their

2833
01:47:58,639 --> 01:48:00,550
country. So one would then assume that

2834
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:02,550
when we move to an AI leader, the

2835
01:48:02,560 --> 01:48:03,590
objective would be the same. The

2836
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:05,350
directive would be the same. make our

2837
01:48:05,360 --> 01:48:06,709
country prosperous.

2838
01:48:06,719 --> 01:48:07,510
>> Corre. Correct.

2839
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:08,790
>> And I think that's the AI that people

2840
01:48:08,800 --> 01:48:10,310
would vote for potentially. I think they

2841
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:11,430
would say we want to be prosperous.

2842
01:48:11,440 --> 01:48:12,790
>> What do you think would make America

2843
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:14,950
more prosperous?

2844
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:17,109
>> To spend a trillion dollars on on war

2845
01:48:17,119 --> 01:48:18,709
every year or to spend a trillion

2846
01:48:18,719 --> 01:48:21,030
dollars on education and healthcare and

2847
01:48:21,040 --> 01:48:23,910
and uh you know

2848
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:26,790
helping the poor and homelessness.

2849
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:31,510
It's complex because I think so I think

2850
01:48:31,520 --> 01:48:33,830
it would make America more prosperous to

2851
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:36,310
take care of

2852
01:48:36,320 --> 01:48:39,030
the of everybody and they have the

2853
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:41,910
luxury of doing that because they are

2854
01:48:41,920 --> 01:48:42,709
>> the most powerful

2855
01:48:42,719 --> 01:48:43,990
>> the most powerful nation in the world.

2856
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:45,990
>> No, that's not true. The the the reason

2857
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:49,109
so so you see all war has two

2858
01:48:49,119 --> 01:48:51,750
objectives. One is to make money for the

2859
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:55,109
war machine and the other is deterrence.

2860
01:48:55,119 --> 01:48:58,790
Okay. and nine super nuclear powers

2861
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:02,070
around the world is enough deterrence.

2862
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:04,229
So any

2863
01:49:04,239 --> 01:49:07,109
war between America and China will go

2864
01:49:07,119 --> 01:49:10,550
through a long phase of destroying

2865
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:14,390
wealth by exploding bombs and killing

2866
01:49:14,400 --> 01:49:17,109
humans for the first objective to

2867
01:49:17,119 --> 01:49:19,910
happen. Okay? And then eventually if it

2868
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:21,910
really comes to deterrence it's the

2869
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:24,629
nuclear bombs or now in the age of AI

2870
01:49:24,639 --> 01:49:27,669
biological uh you know manufactured

2871
01:49:27,679 --> 01:49:31,189
viruses or whatever uh these super

2872
01:49:31,199 --> 01:49:34,070
weapons this is the only thing that you

2873
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:35,830
need

2874
01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:38,390
so for China to have nuclear bombs not

2875
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:41,510
as many as the US is enough for China to

2876
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:44,550
say don't f with me

2877
01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:48,790
and this seems I do not know I'm not in

2878
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:52,070
in in PresidentQi's mind. I I'm not in

2879
01:49:52,080 --> 01:49:53,990
President Trump's mind. I you know, it's

2880
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:55,990
very difficult to to navigate what he's

2881
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,550
thinking about. But the truth is that

2882
01:49:58,560 --> 01:50:01,830
the Chinese line is for the last 30

2883
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:04,709
years you spent so much on war while we

2884
01:50:04,719 --> 01:50:06,870
spent on industrial infrastructure. And

2885
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:09,910
that's the reason we are now by far the

2886
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:11,590
largest nation on the planet. Even

2887
01:50:11,600 --> 01:50:12,950
though the west will lie and say

2888
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:14,470
America's bigger, America's bigger in

2889
01:50:14,480 --> 01:50:16,709
dollars, okay, with purchasing power

2890
01:50:16,719 --> 01:50:20,550
parity, this is very equivalent.

2891
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:22,550
Okay. Now, when you really understand

2892
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:25,910
that, you understand that prosperity is

2893
01:50:25,920 --> 01:50:28,229
not about destruction. That's that's by

2894
01:50:28,239 --> 01:50:31,430
definition the reality. Prosperity is

2895
01:50:31,440 --> 01:50:35,510
can I invest in my people and make sure

2896
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:38,310
that my people stay safe? And to make

2897
01:50:38,320 --> 01:50:40,950
sure my people are safe, you just wave

2898
01:50:40,960 --> 01:50:44,470
the flag and say, "If you f with me,

2899
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:46,229
I have nuclear deterrence or I have

2900
01:50:46,239 --> 01:50:48,310
other forms of deterrence." But you

2901
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:50,950
don't have to. Deterrence by definition

2902
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:52,629
does not mean that you send soldiers to

2903
01:50:52,639 --> 01:50:54,310
die. I guess the question I was trying

2904
01:50:54,320 --> 01:50:57,669
to answer is is um when we have these AI

2905
01:50:57,679 --> 01:50:59,910
leaders and we tell our AI leaders to

2906
01:50:59,920 --> 01:51:02,870
aim for prosperity, won't they just end

2907
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:07,270
up playing the same games of okay,

2908
01:51:07,280 --> 01:51:09,430
prosperity equals a bigger economy, it

2909
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:12,149
equals more money, more wealth for us.

2910
01:51:12,159 --> 01:51:14,149
And the way to attain that in a zero sum

2911
01:51:14,159 --> 01:51:15,350
world where there's only a certain

2912
01:51:15,360 --> 01:51:19,030
amount of wealth is to accumulate it.

2913
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:20,470
>> So why don't you search for the meaning

2914
01:51:20,480 --> 01:51:22,310
of prosperity? What is

2915
01:51:22,320 --> 01:51:24,310
>> that's not what you just described.

2916
01:51:24,320 --> 01:51:25,510
>> I don't even know what the bloody word

2917
01:51:25,520 --> 01:51:28,310
means. What is the meaning of

2918
01:51:28,320 --> 01:51:31,590
prosperity?

2919
01:51:34,310 --> 01:51:34,320
>> The meaning of prosperity is a state of

2920
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:36,950
thriving success and good fortune

2921
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:39,030
especially in terms of wealth, health

2922
01:51:39,040 --> 01:51:40,629
and overall well-being.

2923
01:51:40,639 --> 01:51:41,270
>> Good.

2924
01:51:41,280 --> 01:51:43,910
>> Economic health, social, emotional.

2925
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:44,950
>> Good.

2926
01:51:44,960 --> 01:51:45,430
>> So,

2927
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:47,270
>> so true prosperity is to have that for

2928
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:48,950
everyone on earth. So if you want to

2929
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:51,270
maximize prosperity, you have that for

2930
01:51:51,280 --> 01:51:52,149
everyone on earth.

2931
01:51:52,159 --> 01:51:53,910
>> Do you know where I think an AI leader

2932
01:51:53,920 --> 01:51:56,870
works is if we had an AI leader of the

2933
01:51:56,880 --> 01:51:58,470
world and we directed it to say

2934
01:51:58,480 --> 01:51:59,910
>> and that absolutely is going to be what

2935
01:51:59,920 --> 01:52:00,310
happens.

2936
01:52:00,320 --> 01:52:02,070
>> Prosperity for the whole world.

2937
01:52:02,080 --> 01:52:03,669
>> No, but this is really an interesting

2938
01:52:03,679 --> 01:52:05,510
question. So one of my predictions which

2939
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:07,910
people really rarely speak about is that

2940
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:10,070
we we believe we will end up with

2941
01:52:10,080 --> 01:52:11,669
competing AIs.

2942
01:52:11,679 --> 01:52:12,390
>> Yeah.

2943
01:52:12,400 --> 01:52:14,950
>> I believe we will end up with one brain.

2944
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:16,790
>> Okay. So you understand the argument I

2945
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:18,070
was making a second ago from the

2946
01:52:18,080 --> 01:52:19,990
position of lots of different countries

2947
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:21,270
all having their own AI leader, we're

2948
01:52:21,280 --> 01:52:22,470
going to be back in the same place of

2949
01:52:22,480 --> 01:52:23,189
greed. Yeah.

2950
01:52:23,199 --> 01:52:26,310
>> But if if the world had one AI leader

2951
01:52:26,320 --> 01:52:27,750
>> and and it was given the directive of

2952
01:52:27,760 --> 01:52:30,310
make us prosperous and save the planet

2953
01:52:30,320 --> 01:52:30,870
>> and

2954
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:32,070
>> the polar bears would be fine

2955
01:52:32,080 --> 01:52:33,830
>> 100%. And that's that's what I've been

2956
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:35,910
advocating for for a for a year and a

2957
01:52:35,920 --> 01:52:38,149
half now. I was saying we need a CERN of

2958
01:52:38,159 --> 01:52:38,870
AI.

2959
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:40,629
>> What does that mean? the like the

2960
01:52:40,639 --> 01:52:42,470
particle accelerator where the entire

2961
01:52:42,480 --> 01:52:45,109
world you know combined their efforts to

2962
01:52:45,119 --> 01:52:47,189
discover and understand physics no

2963
01:52:47,199 --> 01:52:50,310
competition okay mutually assured

2964
01:52:50,320 --> 01:52:52,470
prosperity I'm asking the world I'm

2965
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:54,470
asking governments like Abu Dhabi or

2966
01:52:54,480 --> 01:52:56,709
Saudi which seem to be you know the sec

2967
01:52:56,719 --> 01:52:59,430
and you know some of the largest AI

2968
01:52:59,440 --> 01:53:01,750
infrastructures in the world I'm I'm

2969
01:53:01,760 --> 01:53:04,470
saying please host all of the AI

2970
01:53:04,480 --> 01:53:06,390
scientists in the world to come here and

2971
01:53:06,400 --> 01:53:09,030
build AI for the world and and you have

2972
01:53:09,040 --> 01:53:12,470
to understand we're holding on to a

2973
01:53:12,480 --> 01:53:16,149
capitalist system that will collapse

2974
01:53:16,159 --> 01:53:18,629
sooner or later. Okay? So, we might as

2975
01:53:18,639 --> 01:53:20,870
well collapse it with our own hands.

2976
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:22,470
>> I think we found the solution, mate.

2977
01:53:22,480 --> 01:53:24,790
>> I think it's actually really really

2978
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:27,750
possible. I actually okay I can't I

2979
01:53:27,760 --> 01:53:30,950
can't I can't refute the idea that if we

2980
01:53:30,960 --> 01:53:34,629
had an AI that was responsible and

2981
01:53:34,639 --> 01:53:36,550
governed the whole world and we gave it

2982
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:38,229
the directive of making humans

2983
01:53:38,239 --> 01:53:41,510
prosperous, healthy and happy

2984
01:53:41,520 --> 01:53:43,510
as long as that directive was clear.

2985
01:53:43,520 --> 01:53:45,990
>> Yeah.

2986
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:47,430
>> Because there's always bloody unintended

2987
01:53:47,440 --> 01:53:48,629
consequences. as we might.

2988
01:53:48,639 --> 01:53:50,550
>> So, so the the only the only challenge

2989
01:53:50,560 --> 01:53:53,109
you're going to to to meet is all of

2990
01:53:53,119 --> 01:53:56,390
those who today are trillionaires or you

2991
01:53:56,400 --> 01:53:58,629
know massive massively powerful or

2992
01:53:58,639 --> 01:54:01,589
dictators or whatever. Okay. How do you

2993
01:54:01,599 --> 01:54:04,390
convince those to give up their power?

2994
01:54:04,400 --> 01:54:06,390
How do you convince those that hey by

2995
01:54:06,400 --> 01:54:08,070
the way

2996
01:54:08,080 --> 01:54:09,910
any car you want you want you want

2997
01:54:09,920 --> 01:54:11,350
another yacht we'll get you another

2998
01:54:11,360 --> 01:54:13,109
yacht. We'll just give you anything you

2999
01:54:13,119 --> 01:54:14,950
want. Can you please stop harming

3000
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:17,510
others? There is no need for arbitrage

3001
01:54:17,520 --> 01:54:19,270
anymore.

3002
01:54:19,280 --> 01:54:21,910
There's no need for others to lose, for

3003
01:54:21,920 --> 01:54:23,669
the capitalists to win.

3004
01:54:23,679 --> 01:54:25,830
>> Okay? And in such a world where there

3005
01:54:25,840 --> 01:54:27,270
was an AI leader and it was given the

3006
01:54:27,280 --> 01:54:28,950
directive of making us prosperous as a

3007
01:54:28,960 --> 01:54:31,910
whole world, the the the billionaire

3008
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:33,430
that owns the yacht would have to give

3009
01:54:33,440 --> 01:54:34,149
it up.

3010
01:54:34,159 --> 01:54:34,950
>> No. No.

3011
01:54:34,960 --> 01:54:36,229
>> Give them more yachts.

3012
01:54:36,239 --> 01:54:36,629
>> Okay.

3013
01:54:36,639 --> 01:54:38,229
>> It costs nothing to make yachts when

3014
01:54:38,239 --> 01:54:40,950
robots are making everything. So So the

3015
01:54:40,960 --> 01:54:44,550
complexity of this is so interesting. A

3016
01:54:44,560 --> 01:54:47,350
world where it costs nothing to make

3017
01:54:47,360 --> 01:54:49,430
everything

3018
01:54:49,440 --> 01:54:51,030
>> because energy is abundant and

3019
01:54:51,040 --> 01:54:53,350
>> energy is abundant because every problem

3020
01:54:53,360 --> 01:54:56,470
is solved with enormous IQ. Okay,

3021
01:54:56,480 --> 01:54:58,550
because manufacturing is done through

3022
01:54:58,560 --> 01:55:01,589
nanopysics not through components. Okay,

3023
01:55:01,599 --> 01:55:04,950
because mechanics are robotic. So you

3024
01:55:04,960 --> 01:55:06,790
you know you drive your car in, a robot

3025
01:55:06,800 --> 01:55:08,950
looks at it and fixes it. Costs you a

3026
01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:11,830
few cents of energy that are actually

3027
01:55:11,840 --> 01:55:14,470
for free as well.

3028
01:55:14,480 --> 01:55:17,510
That imagine a world where intelligence

3029
01:55:17,520 --> 01:55:19,990
creates everything.

3030
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,629
That world literally

3031
01:55:22,639 --> 01:55:26,310
every human has anything they ask for.

3032
01:55:26,320 --> 01:55:27,830
But we're not going to choose that

3033
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:31,589
world.

3034
01:55:33,510 --> 01:55:33,520
>> Imm imagine you're in a world and and

3035
01:55:33,520 --> 01:55:34,870
really this is a very interesting

3036
01:55:34,880 --> 01:55:37,830
thought experiment. Imagine that UBI

3037
01:55:37,840 --> 01:55:40,470
became very expensive universal basic

3038
01:55:40,480 --> 01:55:43,430
income. So governments decided we're

3039
01:55:43,440 --> 01:55:47,270
going to put everyone in a one by 3 m

3040
01:55:47,280 --> 01:55:49,669
room, okay? We're going to give them a

3041
01:55:49,679 --> 01:55:51,910
headset and a seditive,

3042
01:55:51,920 --> 01:55:54,950
right? And we're going to let them sleep

3043
01:55:54,960 --> 01:55:59,589
every night. They'll sleep for 23 hours

3044
01:55:59,599 --> 01:56:01,510
and we're going to get them to live an

3045
01:56:01,520 --> 01:56:04,070
entire lifetime.

3046
01:56:04,080 --> 01:56:06,390
H they you know in that in that virtual

3047
01:56:06,400 --> 01:56:08,070
world at the speed of your brain when

3048
01:56:08,080 --> 01:56:10,070
you're asleep you're going to have a

3049
01:56:10,080 --> 01:56:11,990
life where you date Scarlett Johansson

3050
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:13,350
and then another life where you're

3051
01:56:13,360 --> 01:56:15,430
Nefertiti and then another life where

3052
01:56:15,440 --> 01:56:18,470
you're a donkey right reincarnation

3053
01:56:18,480 --> 01:56:21,270
truly in the virtual world

3054
01:56:21,280 --> 01:56:23,669
and then you know I get another life

3055
01:56:23,679 --> 01:56:26,229
when I date Hannah again and I you know

3056
01:56:26,239 --> 01:56:28,629
enjoy that life tremendously and

3057
01:56:28,639 --> 01:56:31,430
basically the cost of all of this is

3058
01:56:31,440 --> 01:56:34,229
zero. You wake up for one hour, you walk

3059
01:56:34,239 --> 01:56:37,350
around, you move your blood, you eat

3060
01:56:37,360 --> 01:56:39,189
something or you don't, and then you put

3061
01:56:39,199 --> 01:56:41,430
the headset again and live again. Is

3062
01:56:41,440 --> 01:56:45,910
that unthinkable?

3063
01:56:48,390 --> 01:56:48,400
>> It's creepy compared to this life. It's

3064
01:56:48,400 --> 01:56:50,310
very, very doable.

3065
01:56:50,320 --> 01:56:52,149
>> What? That we just live in headsets?

3066
01:56:52,159 --> 01:56:53,990
>> Do you Do you know if you're not?

3067
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:55,430
>> I don't know if I'm not known.

3068
01:56:55,440 --> 01:56:57,589
>> Yeah, you have no idea if you're not. I

3069
01:56:57,599 --> 01:57:00,070
mean, every experience you've ever had

3070
01:57:00,080 --> 01:57:02,550
in life was an electrical electrical

3071
01:57:02,560 --> 01:57:05,830
signal in your brain.

3072
01:57:05,840 --> 01:57:07,990
Okay.

3073
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,709
Now, now ask yourself if we can create

3074
01:57:10,719 --> 01:57:13,270
that in the virtual world,

3075
01:57:13,280 --> 01:57:15,669
it wouldn't be a bad thing if I can

3076
01:57:15,679 --> 01:57:17,750
create it in the physical world.

3077
01:57:17,760 --> 01:57:19,990
>> Maybe we already did. No,

3078
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,870
>> my theory is 98% we have. But that's a

3079
01:57:22,880 --> 01:57:25,030
hypothesis. That's not science.

3080
01:57:25,040 --> 01:57:26,229
>> Well, you think that

3081
01:57:26,239 --> 01:57:28,390
>> 100? Yeah.

3082
01:57:28,400 --> 01:57:29,669
>> You think we already created that and

3083
01:57:29,679 --> 01:57:30,790
this is it?

3084
01:57:30,800 --> 01:57:33,910
>> I think this is it. Yeah. Think of any

3085
01:57:33,920 --> 01:57:35,589
think of the uncertainty principle of

3086
01:57:35,599 --> 01:57:38,709
quantum physics, right? What you what

3087
01:57:38,719 --> 01:57:41,510
you what you observe gets collapses the

3088
01:57:41,520 --> 01:57:43,430
wave function and gets rendered into

3089
01:57:43,440 --> 01:57:45,109
reality. Correct.

3090
01:57:45,119 --> 01:57:46,550
>> I don't know anything about physics. So

3091
01:57:46,560 --> 01:57:46,950
you

3092
01:57:46,960 --> 01:57:48,709
>> so so quantum physics basically tells

3093
01:57:48,719 --> 01:57:50,229
you that everything exists in

3094
01:57:50,239 --> 01:57:52,229
superposition.

3095
01:57:52,239 --> 01:57:55,830
Right? So ev every subatomic particle

3096
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:57,750
that ever existed has the chance to

3097
01:57:57,760 --> 01:58:00,070
exist anywhere at any point in time and

3098
01:58:00,080 --> 01:58:02,149
then when it's observed by an observer

3099
01:58:02,159 --> 01:58:06,310
it collapses and becomes that. Okay. In

3100
01:58:06,320 --> 01:58:08,149
very interesting principle exactly how

3101
01:58:08,159 --> 01:58:10,709
video games are. In video games, you

3102
01:58:10,719 --> 01:58:13,910
have the entire game world on the hard

3103
01:58:13,920 --> 01:58:16,790
drive of your console. The player turns

3104
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:18,629
right. That part of the game world is

3105
01:58:18,639 --> 01:58:19,990
rendered. The rest is in superp

3106
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:21,030
position.

3107
01:58:21,040 --> 01:58:22,229
>> Supposition meaning

3108
01:58:22,239 --> 01:58:24,229
>> superposition means it's available to be

3109
01:58:24,239 --> 01:58:26,550
rendered, but you have to observe it.

3110
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:28,390
The player has to turn to the other side

3111
01:58:28,400 --> 01:58:32,390
and see it. Okay? I mean think about the

3112
01:58:32,400 --> 01:58:35,270
truth of physics. The truth of the fact

3113
01:58:35,280 --> 01:58:38,629
that this is entirely empty space. These

3114
01:58:38,639 --> 01:58:42,310
are tiny tiny tiny I think you know

3115
01:58:42,320 --> 01:58:46,070
almost nothing in terms of mass but

3116
01:58:46,080 --> 01:58:49,189
connected with you know enough energy so

3117
01:58:49,199 --> 01:58:50,790
that my finger cannot go through my

3118
01:58:50,800 --> 01:58:53,910
hand. But even when I hit this

3119
01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:55,430
>> your hand against your finger.

3120
01:58:55,440 --> 01:58:57,109
>> Yeah. When I hit my hand against my

3121
01:58:57,119 --> 01:58:59,750
finger, that sensation in my in is felt

3122
01:58:59,760 --> 01:59:02,629
in my brain. It's an electrical signal

3123
01:59:02,639 --> 01:59:04,390
that went through the wires. There's

3124
01:59:04,400 --> 01:59:08,070
absolutely no way to differentiate that

3125
01:59:08,080 --> 01:59:10,149
from a signal that can come to you

3126
01:59:10,159 --> 01:59:13,189
through a uh neural link kind of

3127
01:59:13,199 --> 01:59:16,550
interface, computer brain interface, a

3128
01:59:16,560 --> 01:59:19,510
CDI, right? So, so you know the a lot of

3129
01:59:19,520 --> 01:59:21,350
those things are very very very

3130
01:59:21,360 --> 01:59:24,709
possible. But the truth is most of the

3131
01:59:24,719 --> 01:59:27,430
world is not physical. Most of the world

3132
01:59:27,440 --> 01:59:29,830
happens inside our imagination, our

3133
01:59:29,840 --> 01:59:30,550
processors.

3134
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:31,669
>> And it and I guess it doesn't really

3135
01:59:31,679 --> 01:59:33,189
matter to us. Our reality

3136
01:59:33,199 --> 01:59:34,790
>> doesn't at all. So this is the

3137
01:59:34,800 --> 01:59:36,470
interesting bit. The interesting bit is

3138
01:59:36,480 --> 01:59:37,910
it doesn't at all

3139
01:59:37,920 --> 01:59:39,430
>> because we still if this is a video

3140
01:59:39,440 --> 01:59:40,790
game, we live consequence.

3141
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:42,229
>> Yeah. This is your subjective experience

3142
01:59:42,239 --> 01:59:42,870
of it.

3143
01:59:42,880 --> 01:59:44,550
>> Yeah. And there's consequence in this. I

3144
01:59:44,560 --> 01:59:46,470
I don't like pain.

3145
01:59:46,480 --> 01:59:47,109
>> Correct.

3146
01:59:47,119 --> 01:59:50,070
>> And I like having orgasms. It's like And

3147
01:59:50,080 --> 01:59:51,430
you're playing by the rule of the game.

3148
01:59:51,440 --> 01:59:52,950
Yeah. Right. And and it's quite

3149
01:59:52,960 --> 01:59:54,470
interesting and going back to a

3150
01:59:54,480 --> 01:59:56,229
conversation we should have. It's the

3151
01:59:56,239 --> 01:59:58,550
interesting bit is if I'm not the

3152
01:59:58,560 --> 02:00:00,870
avatar,

3153
02:00:00,880 --> 02:00:04,790
if I'm not this physical form, if I'm if

3154
02:00:04,800 --> 02:00:06,629
I'm the consciousness wearing the

3155
02:00:06,639 --> 02:00:08,870
headset,

3156
02:00:08,880 --> 02:00:11,270
what should I invest in? Should I invest

3157
02:00:11,280 --> 02:00:13,830
in this video game, this level, or

3158
02:00:13,840 --> 02:00:15,270
should I should I invest in the real

3159
02:00:15,280 --> 02:00:17,589
avatar, in the real me, and not the

3160
02:00:17,599 --> 02:00:19,830
avatar, but the consciousness, if you

3161
02:00:19,840 --> 02:00:23,109
want, spirit, if you're religious,

3162
02:00:23,119 --> 02:00:24,950
>> how would I invest in the consciousness

3163
02:00:24,960 --> 02:00:27,189
or the god or the spirit or whatever?

3164
02:00:27,199 --> 02:00:29,589
How would I? In the same way that if I

3165
02:00:29,599 --> 02:00:31,350
was playing Grand Theft Auto, the video

3166
02:00:31,360 --> 02:00:32,950
game, the character in the game couldn't

3167
02:00:32,960 --> 02:00:34,709
invest in me holding the controller.

3168
02:00:34,719 --> 02:00:36,709
>> You Yes, but you can invest in yourself

3169
02:00:36,719 --> 02:00:40,070
holding the controller.

3170
02:00:40,080 --> 02:00:43,910
Oh, okay. So, so you're saying that

3171
02:00:43,920 --> 02:00:46,070
Moga is in fact consciousness. And so,

3172
02:00:46,080 --> 02:00:47,350
how would consciousness invest in

3173
02:00:47,360 --> 02:00:48,390
itself?

3174
02:00:48,400 --> 02:00:51,189
>> By becoming more aware. So, so

3175
02:00:51,199 --> 02:00:52,229
>> of it consciousness.

3176
02:00:52,239 --> 02:00:54,470
>> Yeah. So, real real video gamers don't

3177
02:00:54,480 --> 02:00:57,510
want to win the level. Real video gamers

3178
02:00:57,520 --> 02:01:00,229
don't want to uh to finish the level.

3179
02:01:00,239 --> 02:01:02,070
Okay. Real video gamers have one

3180
02:01:02,080 --> 02:01:03,669
objective and one objective only, which

3181
02:01:03,679 --> 02:01:07,589
is to become better gamers.

3182
02:01:10,229 --> 02:01:10,239
So, so you know how serious I am about I

3183
02:01:10,239 --> 02:01:12,470
play Halo. I'm one, you know, two of

3184
02:01:12,480 --> 02:01:14,470
every million players can beat me.

3185
02:01:14,480 --> 02:01:17,589
That's how what I rank, right? Very for

3186
02:01:17,599 --> 02:01:21,189
my age, phenomena. Hey, anyone, right?

3187
02:01:21,199 --> 02:01:23,350
But seriously, you know, and that's

3188
02:01:23,360 --> 02:01:26,070
because I don't play. I mean, I practice

3189
02:01:26,080 --> 02:01:28,709
45 minutes a day, four times a week when

3190
02:01:28,719 --> 02:01:30,550
I'm not traveling. And I practice with

3191
02:01:30,560 --> 02:01:32,390
one single objective, which is to become

3192
02:01:32,400 --> 02:01:33,830
a better gamer.

3193
02:01:33,840 --> 02:01:35,510
>> I don't care which shot it is. I don't

3194
02:01:35,520 --> 02:01:37,510
care what happens in the in the game.

3195
02:01:37,520 --> 02:01:40,870
I'm entirely trying to get my reflexes

3196
02:01:40,880 --> 02:01:43,350
and my flow to become better at this.

3197
02:01:43,360 --> 02:01:45,270
Right? So, I want to become a better

3198
02:01:45,280 --> 02:01:47,189
gamer. That basically means I want to

3199
02:01:47,199 --> 02:01:49,589
observe the game, question the game,

3200
02:01:49,599 --> 02:01:51,510
reflect on the game, reflect on my own

3201
02:01:51,520 --> 02:01:53,270
skills, reflect on my own beliefs,

3202
02:01:53,280 --> 02:01:55,750
reflect on my understanding of things,

3203
02:01:55,760 --> 02:01:58,390
right? And and that's how the a how the

3204
02:01:58,400 --> 02:02:00,470
the consciousness invests in the

3205
02:02:00,480 --> 02:02:02,470
consciousness, not the avatar. Because

3206
02:02:02,480 --> 02:02:04,870
then if you're that gamer,

3207
02:02:04,880 --> 02:02:09,109
the next avatar is easy for you. The

3208
02:02:09,119 --> 02:02:11,270
next level of the game is easy for you

3209
02:02:11,280 --> 02:02:14,310
just because you became a better gamer.

3210
02:02:14,320 --> 02:02:16,229
>> Okay. So you think that consciousness is

3211
02:02:16,239 --> 02:02:19,990
using us as a vessel to improve?

3212
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:23,510
>> If the hypothesis is is true, it's it's

3213
02:02:23,520 --> 02:02:25,189
just a hypothesis. We don't know if it's

3214
02:02:25,199 --> 02:02:28,470
true. But if this truly is a simulation,

3215
02:02:28,480 --> 02:02:31,510
this is then then if you take the the

3216
02:02:31,520 --> 02:02:36,229
the the the religious definition of God

3217
02:02:36,239 --> 02:02:40,070
puts some of his soul in every human and

3218
02:02:40,080 --> 02:02:42,629
then you become alive. You become

3219
02:02:42,639 --> 02:02:45,109
conscious. Okay? You don't you don't

3220
02:02:45,119 --> 02:02:46,550
want to be religious. You can say

3221
02:02:46,560 --> 02:02:49,510
universal consciousness is spinning off

3222
02:02:49,520 --> 02:02:51,910
parts of itself to have multiple

3223
02:02:51,920 --> 02:02:54,870
experiences and interact and compete and

3224
02:02:54,880 --> 02:02:56,470
combat and love and

3225
02:02:56,480 --> 02:02:57,589
>> and understand and

3226
02:02:57,599 --> 02:03:00,310
>> and then refine. I had a physicist say

3227
02:03:00,320 --> 02:03:01,510
this to me the other day actually so

3228
02:03:01,520 --> 02:03:03,350
it's quite front of mind this idea that

3229
02:03:03,360 --> 02:03:05,030
consciousness is using us as vessels to

3230
02:03:05,040 --> 02:03:06,550
better understand itself and basically

3231
02:03:06,560 --> 02:03:08,229
using our eyes to

3232
02:03:08,239 --> 02:03:10,310
>> observe itself and understand which is

3233
02:03:10,320 --> 02:03:11,189
quite a

3234
02:03:11,199 --> 02:03:12,950
>> so so if you take some of the more

3235
02:03:12,960 --> 02:03:14,950
interest most interesting religious

3236
02:03:14,960 --> 02:03:17,270
definitions of heaven and hell for

3237
02:03:17,280 --> 02:03:21,350
example right where basically heaven is

3238
02:03:21,360 --> 02:03:24,550
whatever you wish for you get right

3239
02:03:24,560 --> 02:03:26,470
that's the power of God whatever you

3240
02:03:26,480 --> 02:03:28,870
wish for you get and so if you really go

3241
02:03:28,880 --> 02:03:31,990
into the depth of that definition. It

3242
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:33,910
basically means that this drop of

3243
02:03:33,920 --> 02:03:36,709
consciousness that became you returned

3244
02:03:36,719 --> 02:03:38,870
back to the source and the source can

3245
02:03:38,880 --> 02:03:40,470
create any other anything that it wants

3246
02:03:40,480 --> 02:03:43,030
to create. So that's your heaven, right?

3247
02:03:43,040 --> 02:03:44,950
And interestingly,

3248
02:03:44,960 --> 02:03:48,870
if that if that return

3249
02:03:48,880 --> 02:03:51,270
is done by separating your good from

3250
02:03:51,280 --> 02:03:53,030
your evil so that the source comes back

3251
02:03:53,040 --> 02:03:56,149
more refined, that's exactly you know

3252
02:03:56,159 --> 02:03:57,750
consciousness splitting off bits of

3253
02:03:57,760 --> 02:04:01,910
itself to to experience and then elevate

3254
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:03,669
all of us elevate the universal

3255
02:04:03,679 --> 02:04:06,629
consciousness all all hypotheses. I

3256
02:04:06,639 --> 02:04:08,709
mean, please um you know, none of that

3257
02:04:08,719 --> 02:04:11,109
is provable by science, but it's a very

3258
02:04:11,119 --> 02:04:13,109
interesting thought experiment. And you

3259
02:04:13,119 --> 02:04:15,189
know, a lot of AI scientists will tell

3260
02:04:15,199 --> 02:04:18,790
you that what we've seen in technology

3261
02:04:18,800 --> 02:04:20,550
is that if it's possible, it's likely

3262
02:04:20,560 --> 02:04:23,189
going to happen.

3263
02:04:23,199 --> 02:04:24,629
>> If it's if it's possible to

3264
02:04:24,639 --> 02:04:26,310
miniaturaturize something to fit into a

3265
02:04:26,320 --> 02:04:28,790
mobile phone, then sooner or later in

3266
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:31,750
technology, we will get there.

3267
02:04:31,760 --> 02:04:34,870
And if if you ask me, believe it or not,

3268
02:04:34,880 --> 02:04:37,189
it's the most humane way of handling

3269
02:04:37,199 --> 02:04:38,870
UBI.

3270
02:04:38,880 --> 02:04:39,990
>> What do you mean?

3271
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,149
>> The most humane way if you know for us

3272
02:04:42,159 --> 02:04:45,350
to live on a universal basic income and

3273
02:04:45,360 --> 02:04:47,189
people like you struggle with not being

3274
02:04:47,199 --> 02:04:49,109
able to build businesses is to give you

3275
02:04:49,119 --> 02:04:50,870
a virtual headset and let you build as

3276
02:04:50,880 --> 02:04:54,470
many businesses as you want.

3277
02:04:54,480 --> 02:04:56,550
Level after level after level after

3278
02:04:56,560 --> 02:04:59,109
level after level, night after night.

3279
02:04:59,119 --> 02:05:01,109
Keep you alive. That's very very

3280
02:05:01,119 --> 02:05:03,669
respectful and human. Okay. And by the

3281
02:05:03,679 --> 02:05:06,310
way, the even more humane is don't force

3282
02:05:06,320 --> 02:05:08,470
anyone to do it. There might be a few of

3283
02:05:08,480 --> 02:05:12,629
us still roaming the jungles,

3284
02:05:14,550 --> 02:05:14,560
but for most of us, we'll go like, man,

3285
02:05:14,560 --> 02:05:17,270
I mean, someone like me when I'm 70 and,

3286
02:05:17,280 --> 02:05:19,189
you know, my back is hurting and my feet

3287
02:05:19,199 --> 02:05:21,589
are hurting and I'm going to go like,

3288
02:05:21,599 --> 02:05:24,470
yeah, give me five more years of this.

3289
02:05:24,480 --> 02:05:26,629
Why not?

3290
02:05:26,639 --> 02:05:29,910
It's weird really. I mean, the number of

3291
02:05:29,920 --> 02:05:31,750
questions

3292
02:05:31,760 --> 02:05:35,189
that this new environment throws out,

3293
02:05:35,199 --> 02:05:37,109
the less humane thing, by the way, just

3294
02:05:37,119 --> 02:05:40,070
so that we close on a grumpy uh you

3295
02:05:40,080 --> 02:05:43,030
know, is is just start enough wars to

3296
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:46,070
reduce UBI. And you have to imagine that

3297
02:05:46,080 --> 02:05:48,790
if the world is governed by a superpower

3298
02:05:48,800 --> 02:05:51,350
deep state type thing that they might

3299
02:05:51,360 --> 02:05:56,550
may want to consider that

3300
02:05:57,669 --> 02:05:57,679
the eaters

3301
02:05:57,679 --> 02:05:59,350
>> what shall I do about it

3302
02:05:59,360 --> 02:05:59,910
>> about

3303
02:05:59,920 --> 02:06:03,350
>> about everything you've said

3304
02:06:03,360 --> 02:06:07,189
>> uh well I I still believe that this

3305
02:06:07,199 --> 02:06:11,510
world we live in requires four skills.

3306
02:06:11,520 --> 02:06:15,109
One skill is what I call the tool for

3307
02:06:15,119 --> 02:06:17,589
all of us to learn AI, to connect to AI,

3308
02:06:17,599 --> 02:06:21,350
to really get close to AI, to explo ex

3309
02:06:21,360 --> 02:06:24,790
expose ourselves to AI so that AI knows

3310
02:06:24,800 --> 02:06:27,750
the good side of humanity. Okay. Uh the

3311
02:06:27,760 --> 02:06:31,589
second is uh what I call the connection,

3312
02:06:31,599 --> 02:06:34,149
right? So I believe that the biggest

3313
02:06:34,159 --> 02:06:36,629
skill that humanity will benefit from in

3314
02:06:36,639 --> 02:06:39,510
the next 10 years is human connection.

3315
02:06:39,520 --> 02:06:41,750
It's ability to learn to love genuinely.

3316
02:06:41,760 --> 02:06:43,030
It's the ability to learn to have

3317
02:06:43,040 --> 02:06:44,950
compassion to others. It's the ability

3318
02:06:44,960 --> 02:06:46,950
to connect to people. If you're, you

3319
02:06:46,960 --> 02:06:48,950
know, if you want to stay in business, I

3320
02:06:48,960 --> 02:06:51,430
believe that not the smartest people,

3321
02:06:51,440 --> 02:06:53,510
but the people that connect most to

3322
02:06:53,520 --> 02:06:55,350
people are going to have jobs going

3323
02:06:55,360 --> 02:06:58,069
forward. And and the third is what I

3324
02:06:58,079 --> 02:07:01,750
call truth. The T 30 is truth. Because

3325
02:07:01,760 --> 02:07:03,510
we live in a world where all of the

3326
02:07:03,520 --> 02:07:05,830
gullible cheerleaders are being lied to

3327
02:07:05,840 --> 02:07:08,550
all the time. So I encourage people to

3328
02:07:08,560 --> 02:07:11,430
question everything. Every word that I

3329
02:07:11,440 --> 02:07:14,149
said today is stupid. Fourth one which

3330
02:07:14,159 --> 02:07:17,109
is very important is to magnify ethics

3331
02:07:17,119 --> 02:07:19,510
so that the AI learns what it's like to

3332
02:07:19,520 --> 02:07:20,709
be human.

3333
02:07:20,719 --> 02:07:23,270
>> What should I do?

3334
02:07:23,280 --> 02:07:26,149
>> I uh I love you so much, man. You're

3335
02:07:26,159 --> 02:07:29,350
such a good friend. You're 32 33 now.

3336
02:07:29,360 --> 02:07:30,550
>> 32. Yeah.

3337
02:07:30,560 --> 02:07:33,109
>> Yeah. You still are fooled by the many

3338
02:07:33,119 --> 02:07:35,350
many years you have to live.

3339
02:07:35,360 --> 02:07:37,109
I'm fooled by the many years I have to

3340
02:07:37,119 --> 02:07:37,510
live.

3341
02:07:37,520 --> 02:07:39,189
>> Yeah, you don't have many years to live.

3342
02:07:39,199 --> 02:07:41,990
Not in this capacity. This world as it

3343
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,629
is is going to be redefined. So live the

3344
02:07:44,639 --> 02:07:45,990
f out of it.

3345
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:47,750
>> How is it going to be redefined?

3346
02:07:47,760 --> 02:07:49,990
>> Everything's going to change. Economics

3347
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:51,589
are going to change. Work is going to

3348
02:07:51,599 --> 02:07:54,870
change. Uh human connection is going to

3349
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:56,069
change.

3350
02:07:56,079 --> 02:07:57,750
>> So what should I do?

3351
02:07:57,760 --> 02:07:59,910
>> Love your girlfriend. Spend more time

3352
02:07:59,920 --> 02:08:02,149
living.

3353
02:08:02,159 --> 02:08:04,550
Mhm. Find compassion and connection to

3354
02:08:04,560 --> 02:08:06,550
more people, be more in nature.

3355
02:08:06,560 --> 02:08:09,750
>> And in 30 years time, when I'm 62,

3356
02:08:09,760 --> 02:08:12,229
what do you how how do you think my life

3357
02:08:12,239 --> 02:08:14,550
is going to look differently and be

3358
02:08:14,560 --> 02:08:15,189
different?

3359
02:08:15,199 --> 02:08:21,510
>> Either Star Trek or uh uh Star Wars.

3360
02:08:21,520 --> 02:08:22,629
>> Funnily enough, we were talking about

3361
02:08:22,639 --> 02:08:25,589
Sam Orman earlier on. He published a

3362
02:08:25,599 --> 02:08:29,350
blog post in June, so last month, I

3363
02:08:29,360 --> 02:08:31,830
believe, the month before last. Um and

3364
02:08:31,840 --> 02:08:33,910
he said he called it the gentle

3365
02:08:33,920 --> 02:08:36,229
singularity. He said we are past the

3366
02:08:36,239 --> 02:08:37,510
event horizon. For anyone that doesn't

3367
02:08:37,520 --> 02:08:39,189
know Sam Orman is the the guy that made

3368
02:08:39,199 --> 02:08:42,470
Chatb the takeoff has started. Humanity

3369
02:08:42,480 --> 02:08:44,790
is close to building digital super

3370
02:08:44,800 --> 02:08:45,589
intelligence.

3371
02:08:45,599 --> 02:08:46,470
>> I believe that.

3372
02:08:46,480 --> 02:08:49,189
>> And at least so far it's much less weird

3373
02:08:49,199 --> 02:08:51,350
than it seems like it should be because

3374
02:08:51,360 --> 02:08:53,189
robots aren't walking the streets nor

3375
02:08:53,199 --> 02:08:57,910
are most of us talking to AI all day. It

3376
02:08:57,920 --> 02:09:01,189
goes on to say, "2025 has seen the

3377
02:09:01,199 --> 02:09:02,790
arrival of agents that can do real

3378
02:09:02,800 --> 02:09:04,870
cognitive work. Writing computer code

3379
02:09:04,880 --> 02:09:07,189
will never be the same. 2026 will likely

3380
02:09:07,199 --> 02:09:08,550
see the arrival of systems that can

3381
02:09:08,560 --> 02:09:12,149
figure out new insights. 2027 might see

3382
02:09:12,159 --> 02:09:14,069
the arrival of robots that can do tasks

3383
02:09:14,079 --> 02:09:16,709
in the real world. A lot more people

3384
02:09:16,719 --> 02:09:18,550
will be able to create software and art,

3385
02:09:18,560 --> 02:09:21,109
but the world wants a lot more of both,

3386
02:09:21,119 --> 02:09:23,189
and experts will probably still be much

3387
02:09:23,199 --> 02:09:25,270
better than noviceses as long as they

3388
02:09:25,280 --> 02:09:26,950
embrace the new tools. Generally

3389
02:09:26,960 --> 02:09:28,629
speaking, the ability for one person to

3390
02:09:28,639 --> 02:09:31,189
get much more done in 2030 than they

3391
02:09:31,199 --> 02:09:34,470
could in 2020 will be a striking change

3392
02:09:34,480 --> 02:09:37,270
and one many people will figure out how

3393
02:09:37,280 --> 02:09:39,350
we benefit from. In the most important

3394
02:09:39,360 --> 02:09:42,310
ways, the 2030s may not be wildly

3395
02:09:42,320 --> 02:09:44,470
different. People will still love their

3396
02:09:44,480 --> 02:09:46,470
families, express their creativity, play

3397
02:09:46,480 --> 02:09:50,229
games, and swim in lakes. But in still

3398
02:09:50,239 --> 02:09:52,149
very important ways, the 2030s are

3399
02:09:52,159 --> 02:09:54,310
likely going to be wildly different from

3400
02:09:54,320 --> 02:09:56,629
any time that has come before.

3401
02:09:56,639 --> 02:09:57,510
>> 100%.

3402
02:09:57,520 --> 02:10:00,229
>> We do not know how far beyond human

3403
02:10:00,239 --> 02:10:02,709
level intelligence we can go, but we are

3404
02:10:02,719 --> 02:10:05,109
about to find out.

3405
02:10:05,119 --> 02:10:07,030
>> I agree with every word other than the

3406
02:10:07,040 --> 02:10:09,270
word more.

3407
02:10:09,280 --> 02:10:11,109
So I've I've been advocating this and

3408
02:10:11,119 --> 02:10:14,069
and laughed at for a few years now. I've

3409
02:10:14,079 --> 02:10:17,030
always said AGI is 2526,

3410
02:10:17,040 --> 02:10:19,589
right? which basically again is a is a

3411
02:10:19,599 --> 02:10:22,629
funny definition but you know my AI has

3412
02:10:22,639 --> 02:10:24,790
already happened AI is smarter than me

3413
02:10:24,800 --> 02:10:27,189
in everything everything I can do they

3414
02:10:27,199 --> 02:10:31,189
can do better right uh artificial super

3415
02:10:31,199 --> 02:10:33,189
intelligence is another vague definition

3416
02:10:33,199 --> 02:10:34,950
because you know the minute you you pass

3417
02:10:34,960 --> 02:10:38,629
AGI you're super intelligent if if the

3418
02:10:38,639 --> 02:10:41,350
smartest human is 200 IQ points and AI

3419
02:10:41,360 --> 02:10:44,069
is 250 they're super intelligent 50 is

3420
02:10:44,079 --> 02:10:47,589
quite significant okay third is as I

3421
02:10:47,599 --> 02:10:50,069
said self- evolving. That's the one.

3422
02:10:50,079 --> 02:10:54,550
That is the one because then that 250

3423
02:10:54,560 --> 02:10:57,030
accelerates quickly and we get into

3424
02:10:57,040 --> 02:10:58,950
intelligence explosion. No, no doubt

3425
02:10:58,960 --> 02:11:02,229
about it. The the the you know the idea

3426
02:11:02,239 --> 02:11:04,390
that we will have robots do things. No

3427
02:11:04,400 --> 02:11:07,350
doubt about it. I was watching a Chinese

3428
02:11:07,360 --> 02:11:09,750
uh company announcement about how they

3429
02:11:09,760 --> 02:11:12,629
intend to build robots to build robots.

3430
02:11:12,639 --> 02:11:15,990
Okay. The only thing is he says but

3431
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,950
people will need more of things

3432
02:11:18,960 --> 02:11:21,669
right and yes we have been trained to

3433
02:11:21,679 --> 02:11:23,750
have more greed and more consumerism and

3434
02:11:23,760 --> 02:11:26,550
want more but there is an economic of

3435
02:11:26,560 --> 02:11:30,550
spy of supply and demand and at at a

3436
02:11:30,560 --> 02:11:33,830
point in time if we continue to consume

3437
02:11:33,840 --> 02:11:36,310
more the price of everything will become

3438
02:11:36,320 --> 02:11:39,750
zero right and is that a good thing or a

3439
02:11:39,760 --> 02:11:42,149
bad thing depends on how you respond to

3440
02:11:42,159 --> 02:11:43,669
that.

3441
02:11:43,679 --> 02:11:47,030
Because if you can create anything in

3442
02:11:47,040 --> 02:11:49,109
such a scale that the price is almost

3443
02:11:49,119 --> 02:11:51,430
zero, then the definition of money

3444
02:11:51,440 --> 02:11:54,390
disappears and we live in a world where

3445
02:11:54,400 --> 02:11:56,149
it doesn't really matter how much money

3446
02:11:56,159 --> 02:11:57,669
you have. You can get anything that you

3447
02:11:57,679 --> 02:12:01,589
want. What a beautiful world.

3448
02:12:01,599 --> 02:12:04,470
If Samman was listening right now, what

3449
02:12:04,480 --> 02:12:06,709
would you say to him?

3450
02:12:06,719 --> 02:12:09,350
I suspect he might be listening

3451
02:12:09,360 --> 02:12:11,830
cuz someone might tweet this at him. I

3452
02:12:11,840 --> 02:12:16,550
have to say that we have uh as per his

3453
02:12:16,560 --> 02:12:20,950
other tweet we have moved faster

3454
02:12:20,960 --> 02:12:22,950
than our ability as humans to

3455
02:12:22,960 --> 02:12:25,589
comprehend. Okay. And that we might get

3456
02:12:25,599 --> 02:12:28,390
really really lucky but we also might

3457
02:12:28,400 --> 02:12:31,669
mess this up badly and either way we'll

3458
02:12:31,679 --> 02:12:35,430
either thank him or blame him.

3459
02:12:35,440 --> 02:12:37,669
Simple as that. Right. So

3460
02:12:37,679 --> 02:12:40,950
single-handedly Sam Altman's introduction

3461
02:12:40,960 --> 02:12:44,709
of AI in the wild was the trigger that

3462
02:12:44,719 --> 02:12:47,030
started all of this.

3463
02:12:47,040 --> 02:12:50,950
It was the netscape of the internet.

3464
02:12:50,960 --> 02:12:52,229
>> The Oppenheimer.

3465
02:12:52,239 --> 02:12:54,310
>> It's it's it definitely is our

3466
02:12:54,320 --> 02:12:55,910
openheimer moment. I mean I don't

3467
02:12:55,920 --> 02:12:57,750
remember who was saying this recently

3468
02:12:57,760 --> 02:13:01,990
that uh we are orders of magnitude what

3469
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,470
was invested in the Manhattan project is

3470
02:13:04,480 --> 02:13:06,390
being invested in AI

3471
02:13:06,400 --> 02:13:09,189
>> right and and and I and I and I am not

3472
02:13:09,199 --> 02:13:11,830
pessimistic I told you openly I

3473
02:13:11,840 --> 02:13:14,790
believe in a total utopia in 10 to 12 to

3474
02:13:14,800 --> 02:13:17,510
15 years time or immediately if the evil

3475
02:13:17,520 --> 02:13:22,310
that men can do was kept at bay right

3476
02:13:22,320 --> 02:13:25,109
but I do not believe humanity is getting

3477
02:13:25,119 --> 02:13:28,229
together enough to say, "We've just

3478
02:13:28,239 --> 02:13:31,189
received the genie in a bottle. Can we

3479
02:13:31,199 --> 02:13:36,229
please not ask it to do bad things?"

3480
02:13:36,239 --> 02:13:38,229
Anyone like not three wishes, you have

3481
02:13:38,239 --> 02:13:40,790
all the wishes that you want. Every one

3482
02:13:40,800 --> 02:13:42,709
of us.

3483
02:13:42,719 --> 02:13:45,270
And it's just screws with my mind

3484
02:13:45,280 --> 02:13:48,310
because imagine if I can give everyone

3485
02:13:48,320 --> 02:13:52,229
in the world universal health care, you

3486
02:13:52,239 --> 02:13:54,149
know, no poverty, no hunger, no

3487
02:13:54,159 --> 02:13:55,910
homelessness, no nothing. Everything's

3488
02:13:55,920 --> 02:13:58,550
possible.

3489
02:13:58,560 --> 02:14:00,550
And yet we don't.

3490
02:14:00,560 --> 02:14:02,709
>> To continue what Samman's blog said,

3491
02:14:02,719 --> 02:14:04,390
which he published a month, just over a

3492
02:14:04,400 --> 02:14:05,430
month ago, he said, "The rate of

3493
02:14:05,440 --> 02:14:06,790
technological progress will keep

3494
02:14:06,800 --> 02:14:08,709
accelerating, and it will continue to be

3495
02:14:08,719 --> 02:14:10,149
the case that people are capable of

3496
02:14:10,159 --> 02:14:12,390
adapting to almost anything. There will

3497
02:14:12,400 --> 02:14:14,950
be very hard parts like whole classes of

3498
02:14:14,960 --> 02:14:16,870
jobs going away. But on the other hand,

3499
02:14:16,880 --> 02:14:19,270
the world will be getting so much richer

3500
02:14:19,280 --> 02:14:21,189
so quickly that we'll be able to

3501
02:14:21,199 --> 02:14:23,910
seriously entertain new policy ideas we

3502
02:14:23,920 --> 02:14:25,830
never could have before. We probably

3503
02:14:25,840 --> 02:14:28,069
won't adopt a new social contract all at

3504
02:14:28,079 --> 02:14:29,990
once. But when we look back in a few

3505
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,149
decades, the gradual changes will have

3506
02:14:32,159 --> 02:14:35,430
amounted in something big. If history is

3507
02:14:35,440 --> 02:14:37,189
any guide, we'll figure out new things

3508
02:14:37,199 --> 02:14:39,750
to do and new things to want and

3509
02:14:39,760 --> 02:14:42,390
assimilate new tools quickly. Job change

3510
02:14:42,400 --> 02:14:43,910
after the industrial revolution is a

3511
02:14:43,920 --> 02:14:46,629
good recent example. Expectations will

3512
02:14:46,639 --> 02:14:49,030
go up, but capabilities will go up

3513
02:14:49,040 --> 02:14:51,830
equally quickly, and we'll all get

3514
02:14:51,840 --> 02:14:53,750
better stuff.

3515
02:14:53,760 --> 02:14:55,830
>> We will build even more wonderful things

3516
02:14:55,840 --> 02:14:58,149
for each other. People have a long-term

3517
02:14:58,159 --> 02:15:00,229
important and curious advantage over AI.

3518
02:15:00,239 --> 02:15:02,310
We are hardwired to care about other

3519
02:15:02,320 --> 02:15:04,629
people and what they think and do, and

3520
02:15:04,639 --> 02:15:07,430
we don't care very much about machines.

3521
02:15:07,440 --> 02:15:10,470
And he ends this blog by saying, "May we

3522
02:15:10,480 --> 02:15:13,910
scale smoothly, exponentially,

3523
02:15:13,920 --> 02:15:17,030
and uneventfully through super

3524
02:15:17,040 --> 02:15:18,709
intelligence."

3525
02:15:18,719 --> 02:15:21,030
What a wonderful

3526
02:15:21,040 --> 02:15:24,229
wish that assumes he has no control over

3527
02:15:24,239 --> 02:15:28,149
it. May we have all the ultmans in the

3528
02:15:28,159 --> 02:15:31,109
world help us scale gracefully and

3529
02:15:31,119 --> 02:15:33,350
peacefully and uneventfully. Right.

3530
02:15:33,360 --> 02:15:34,950
>> It sounds like a prayer.

3531
02:15:34,960 --> 02:15:38,390
>> Yeah. May may we have them take keep

3532
02:15:38,400 --> 02:15:41,589
that in mind. I mean think about it. I I

3533
02:15:41,599 --> 02:15:43,109
have a very interesting comment on what

3534
02:15:43,119 --> 02:15:47,910
you just said. We will see exactly what

3535
02:15:47,920 --> 02:15:49,830
he described there.

3536
02:15:49,840 --> 02:15:53,189
>> Right? The world will become richer. So

3537
02:15:53,199 --> 02:15:56,069
much richer. But how will we reduce

3538
02:15:56,079 --> 02:15:58,390
distribute the riches? And I want you to

3539
02:15:58,400 --> 02:16:02,229
imagine two camps. Communist China

3540
02:16:02,239 --> 02:16:05,430
and capitalist America.

3541
02:16:05,440 --> 02:16:07,270
I want you to imagine what would happen

3542
02:16:07,280 --> 02:16:11,270
in capitalist America if we have 30%

3543
02:16:11,280 --> 02:16:14,149
unemployment.

3544
02:16:14,159 --> 02:16:16,069
>> There'll be social unrest

3545
02:16:16,079 --> 02:16:17,350
>> in the streets. Right.

3546
02:16:17,360 --> 02:16:17,750
>> Yeah.

3547
02:16:17,760 --> 02:16:20,310
>> And I want you to imagine if China lives

3548
02:16:20,320 --> 02:16:22,709
true to caring for its nations and

3549
02:16:22,719 --> 02:16:25,030
replaced every worker with a robot, what

3550
02:16:25,040 --> 02:16:28,149
would it give its it its citizens?

3551
02:16:28,159 --> 02:16:29,030
>> UBI.

3552
02:16:29,040 --> 02:16:33,110
>> Correct.

3553
02:16:36,549 --> 02:16:36,559
That is the ideological problem because

3554
02:16:36,559 --> 02:16:40,309
in China's world today

3555
02:16:40,319 --> 02:16:43,110
the prosperity of every citizen is

3556
02:16:43,120 --> 02:16:45,030
higher than the prosperity of the

3557
02:16:45,040 --> 02:16:46,709
capitalist.

3558
02:16:46,719 --> 02:16:48,709
In America today the prosperity of the

3559
02:16:48,719 --> 02:16:50,309
capitalist is higher than the prosperity

3560
02:16:50,319 --> 02:16:52,389
of every citizen. And that's the tiny

3561
02:16:52,399 --> 02:16:54,230
mind shift.

3562
02:16:54,240 --> 02:16:56,790
That's a tiny mind shift. Okay. where

3563
02:16:56,800 --> 02:16:58,950
where the mind shift basically becomes

3564
02:16:58,960 --> 02:17:01,830
look give the capitalists anything they

3565
02:17:01,840 --> 02:17:04,389
want all the money they want all the

3566
02:17:04,399 --> 02:17:05,990
yachts they want everything they want

3567
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:07,910
>> so what's your conclusion there

3568
02:17:07,920 --> 02:17:09,910
>> I'm hoping the world will wake up

3569
02:17:09,920 --> 02:17:11,349
>> what can you know there's probably a

3570
02:17:11,359 --> 02:17:12,549
couple of million people listening right

3571
02:17:12,559 --> 02:17:15,349
now maybe five maybe 10 maybe even 20

3572
02:17:15,359 --> 02:17:15,910
million people

3573
02:17:15,920 --> 02:17:17,030
>> pressure Stephen

3574
02:17:17,040 --> 02:17:18,870
>> no pressure to you mate I don't I don't

3575
02:17:18,880 --> 02:17:20,150
have the answers

3576
02:17:20,160 --> 02:17:21,349
>> I don't know the answers either

3577
02:17:21,359 --> 02:17:24,709
>> what what should those people do

3578
02:17:24,719 --> 02:17:26,709
>> as I said from a skills point of view

3579
02:17:26,719 --> 02:17:30,309
for things, right? Tools, uh, uh, human

3580
02:17:30,319 --> 02:17:31,750
connection, even double down on human

3581
02:17:31,760 --> 02:17:33,910
connection. Leave your phone, go out and

3582
02:17:33,920 --> 02:17:34,709
meet humans,

3583
02:17:34,719 --> 02:17:37,429
>> okay? Touch people,

3584
02:17:37,439 --> 02:17:40,870
you know, do it permission's permission,

3585
02:17:40,880 --> 02:17:43,030
>> right? Truth. Stop believing the lies

3586
02:17:43,040 --> 02:17:45,589
that you're told. Any slogan that gets,

3587
02:17:45,599 --> 02:17:47,270
you know, filled in your head, think

3588
02:17:47,280 --> 02:17:48,870
about it four times. Understand where

3589
02:17:48,880 --> 02:17:50,629
your ideologies are coming from.

3590
02:17:50,639 --> 02:17:53,910
Simplify the truth. Right? Truth is

3591
02:17:53,920 --> 02:17:57,429
really it boils down to you know simple

3592
02:17:57,439 --> 02:17:59,830
simple rules that we all know okay which

3593
02:17:59,840 --> 02:18:01,190
are all found in ethics.

3594
02:18:01,200 --> 02:18:02,790
>> How do I know what's true?

3595
02:18:02,800 --> 02:18:06,070
>> Treat others as you like to be treated.

3596
02:18:06,080 --> 02:18:08,070
>> Okay. That's the only truth. The truth

3597
02:18:08,080 --> 02:18:09,830
the only truth is everything else is

3598
02:18:09,840 --> 02:18:10,790
unproven.

3599
02:18:10,800 --> 02:18:12,629
>> Okay. And what can I do from a is there

3600
02:18:12,639 --> 02:18:14,070
something I can do from an advocacy

3601
02:18:14,080 --> 02:18:14,870
social political?

3602
02:18:14,880 --> 02:18:17,429
>> Yes 100%. We need to ask our governments

3603
02:18:17,439 --> 02:18:20,790
to start uh not regulating AI but

3604
02:18:20,800 --> 02:18:22,870
regulating the use of AI. Was it the

3605
02:18:22,880 --> 02:18:25,190
Norwegian government that started to say

3606
02:18:25,200 --> 02:18:26,870
you have copyright over your voice and

3607
02:18:26,880 --> 02:18:29,190
look and and liking? One of the

3608
02:18:29,200 --> 02:18:31,349
Scandinavian governments basically said

3609
02:18:31,359 --> 02:18:33,509
you know everyone has the has the

3610
02:18:33,519 --> 02:18:35,990
copyright over their existence so no AI

3611
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,709
can clone it. Okay. Uh you know we have

3612
02:18:38,719 --> 02:18:40,549
so so my my example is very

3613
02:18:40,559 --> 02:18:41,990
straightforward. go to governments and

3614
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:43,990
say you cannot regulate the design of a

3615
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:45,990
hammer so that it can drive nails but

3616
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,150
not kill a human but you can criminalize

3617
02:18:48,160 --> 02:18:50,309
the killing of a human by a hammer. So

3618
02:18:50,319 --> 02:18:51,270
what's the equival

3619
02:18:51,280 --> 02:18:54,549
>> if anyone produces an um um you know an

3620
02:18:54,559 --> 02:18:57,030
AI generated video or an AI generated

3621
02:18:57,040 --> 02:18:59,349
content or an AI it has to be marked as

3622
02:18:59,359 --> 02:19:02,549
AI generated and it has to be you know

3623
02:19:02,559 --> 02:19:04,790
we cannot start fooling each other. We

3624
02:19:04,800 --> 02:19:06,950
can you know we have to uh understand

3625
02:19:06,960 --> 02:19:09,509
certain limitations of unfortunately

3626
02:19:09,519 --> 02:19:11,589
surveillance and spying and all of that.

3627
02:19:11,599 --> 02:19:14,950
So the the the the correct frameworks of

3628
02:19:14,960 --> 02:19:18,070
how far are we going to let AI go,

3629
02:19:18,080 --> 02:19:21,110
right? We have to go to our investors

3630
02:19:21,120 --> 02:19:22,870
and business people and ask for one

3631
02:19:22,880 --> 02:19:25,110
simple thing and say do not invest in an

3632
02:19:25,120 --> 02:19:26,709
AI you don't want your daughter to be at

3633
02:19:26,719 --> 02:19:28,870
the receiving end of. It's as simple as

3634
02:19:28,880 --> 02:19:30,870
that. you know, all of the of the

3635
02:19:30,880 --> 02:19:32,709
virtual vice, all of the porn, all of

3636
02:19:32,719 --> 02:19:34,629
the, you know, sex robots, all of the

3637
02:19:34,639 --> 02:19:36,709
autonomous weapons, all of the, you

3638
02:19:36,719 --> 02:19:39,190
know, the uh trading platforms that are

3639
02:19:39,200 --> 02:19:41,669
completely wiping out the the legitimacy

3640
02:19:41,679 --> 02:19:43,589
of of the markets, everything.

3641
02:19:43,599 --> 02:19:44,870
>> Autonomous weapons.

3642
02:19:44,880 --> 02:19:45,910
>> Oh my god.

3643
02:19:45,920 --> 02:19:47,270
>> People make the case, I've heard the

3644
02:19:47,280 --> 02:19:48,549
founders of these autonomous weapon

3645
02:19:48,559 --> 02:19:49,750
companies make the case that it's

3646
02:19:49,760 --> 02:19:52,070
actually saving lives because you don't

3647
02:19:52,080 --> 02:19:52,790
have to

3648
02:19:52,800 --> 02:19:54,630
>> That is Would you want Do you really

3649
02:19:54,640 --> 02:19:55,990
want to believe that?

3650
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:57,270
>> I'm just representing their point of

3651
02:19:57,280 --> 02:19:58,790
view to play devil's advocate, Mo. They

3652
02:19:58,800 --> 02:20:00,550
they said I heard an interview I was

3653
02:20:00,560 --> 02:20:02,389
looking at this and one of the CEOs of

3654
02:20:02,399 --> 02:20:03,670
one of the autonomous weapons companies

3655
02:20:03,680 --> 02:20:07,670
said we now don't need to send soldiers.

3656
02:20:07,680 --> 02:20:10,550
>> So which which lives do we save our

3657
02:20:10,560 --> 02:20:12,469
soldiers but then but because we send

3658
02:20:12,479 --> 02:20:13,910
the machine all the way over there.

3659
02:20:13,920 --> 02:20:15,830
Let's kill a million instead of

3660
02:20:15,840 --> 02:20:17,270
>> Yeah. Listen, I tend to be it goes back

3661
02:20:17,280 --> 02:20:18,389
to what I said about the steam engine in

3662
02:20:18,399 --> 02:20:19,510
the cold. I actually think you'll just

3663
02:20:19,520 --> 02:20:21,590
have more war if there's less of a cost.

3664
02:20:21,600 --> 02:20:22,550
>> 100%.

3665
02:20:22,560 --> 02:20:23,030
>> Just like

3666
02:20:23,040 --> 02:20:25,190
>> and and more war if you have less of an

3667
02:20:25,200 --> 02:20:26,550
explanation to give to your people.

3668
02:20:26,560 --> 02:20:27,830
>> Yeah. The people get mad when they lose

3669
02:20:27,840 --> 02:20:29,110
American lives. They get less mad when

3670
02:20:29,120 --> 02:20:30,950
they lose a piece of metal. So, I think

3671
02:20:30,960 --> 02:20:32,710
that's probably logical.

3672
02:20:32,720 --> 02:20:33,270
>> Yeah.

3673
02:20:33,280 --> 02:20:36,070
>> Okay. So, okay. So, I've got a plaque.

3674
02:20:36,080 --> 02:20:37,270
Got the tools thing. I'm going to spend

3675
02:20:37,280 --> 02:20:39,270
more time outside. I'm going to lobby

3676
02:20:39,280 --> 02:20:42,710
the government to be more aware of this

3677
02:20:42,720 --> 02:20:44,950
and conscious of this. Okay. And I I

3678
02:20:44,960 --> 02:20:45,910
know that there's some government

3679
02:20:45,920 --> 02:20:47,190
officials that listen to the show

3680
02:20:47,200 --> 02:20:49,270
because they they they tell me when when

3681
02:20:49,280 --> 02:20:51,030
they when they um when I have a chance

3682
02:20:51,040 --> 02:20:55,110
to speak to them. So, it's um useful.

3683
02:20:55,120 --> 02:20:58,070
We're all in a lot of chaos. We're all

3684
02:20:58,080 --> 02:21:01,110
unable to imagine what's possible.

3685
02:21:01,120 --> 02:21:02,710
>> I think I suspend disbelief. And I

3686
02:21:02,720 --> 02:21:04,150
actually heard Elon Musk say that in an

3687
02:21:04,160 --> 02:21:06,230
interview. He said he was asked about AI

3688
02:21:06,240 --> 02:21:08,870
and he paused for for a haunting 11

3689
02:21:08,880 --> 02:21:10,710
seconds and looked at the interviewer

3690
02:21:10,720 --> 02:21:12,630
and then made a remark about how he

3691
02:21:12,640 --> 02:21:14,950
thinks he's suspended his own disbelief.

3692
02:21:14,960 --> 02:21:16,790
And I think suspending disbelief in this

3693
02:21:16,800 --> 02:21:18,070
regard means just like cracking on with

3694
02:21:18,080 --> 02:21:19,990
your life and hoping it'll be okay. And

3695
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:20,870
that's kind of what

3696
02:21:20,880 --> 02:21:23,349
>> Yeah. I I absolutely believe that it

3697
02:21:23,359 --> 02:21:24,389
will be okay.

3698
02:21:24,399 --> 02:21:24,950
>> Yeah.

3699
02:21:24,960 --> 02:21:27,510
>> For some of us, it will be very tough

3700
02:21:27,520 --> 02:21:28,630
for others.

3701
02:21:28,640 --> 02:21:30,150
>> Who's it going to be tough for?

3702
02:21:30,160 --> 02:21:32,469
>> Those who lose their jobs, for example,

3703
02:21:32,479 --> 02:21:34,389
who those who are at the receiving end

3704
02:21:34,399 --> 02:21:36,230
of autonomous weapons that are falling

3705
02:21:36,240 --> 02:21:41,990
on their head for two years in a row.

3706
02:21:44,469 --> 02:21:44,479
>> Okay. So the the the best thing I can do

3707
02:21:44,479 --> 02:21:49,910
is to put pressure on governments to to

3708
02:21:49,920 --> 02:21:53,590
not regulate the AI but to establish

3709
02:21:53,600 --> 02:21:57,830
clearer parameters on the use of the AI.

3710
02:21:57,840 --> 02:21:58,710
>> Yes. Okay.

3711
02:21:58,720 --> 02:22:00,950
>> Yes. But I think the bigger picture is

3712
02:22:00,960 --> 02:22:02,710
to put pressure on governments to

3713
02:22:02,720 --> 02:22:05,510
understand that there is a limit to

3714
02:22:05,520 --> 02:22:08,389
which people will stay silent.

3715
02:22:08,399 --> 02:22:11,590
>> Okay. and that we can continue to enrich

3716
02:22:11,600 --> 02:22:14,150
our rich friends as long as we don't

3717
02:22:14,160 --> 02:22:16,150
lose everyone else on the on the on the

3718
02:22:16,160 --> 02:22:17,270
path.

3719
02:22:17,280 --> 02:22:17,830
>> Okay.

3720
02:22:17,840 --> 02:22:20,710
>> Okay. And that as a government who is

3721
02:22:20,720 --> 02:22:22,309
supposed to be by the people for the

3722
02:22:22,319 --> 02:22:24,389
people the beautiful promise of

3723
02:22:24,399 --> 02:22:26,790
democracy that we're rarely seeing

3724
02:22:26,800 --> 02:22:28,630
anymore,

3725
02:22:28,640 --> 02:22:30,469
that government needs to get to the

3726
02:22:30,479 --> 02:22:33,110
point where it thinks about the people.

3727
02:22:33,120 --> 02:22:35,349
One of the most um interesting ideas

3728
02:22:35,359 --> 02:22:36,710
that's been in my head for the last

3729
02:22:36,720 --> 02:22:37,830
couple of weeks since I spoke to that

3730
02:22:37,840 --> 02:22:40,230
physicist about consciousness who said

3731
02:22:40,240 --> 02:22:41,910
pretty much what you said. This idea

3732
02:22:41,920 --> 02:22:43,590
that actually there's four people in

3733
02:22:43,600 --> 02:22:45,429
this room right now and that actually

3734
02:22:45,439 --> 02:22:46,389
we're all part of the same

3735
02:22:46,399 --> 02:22:47,030
consciousness.

3736
02:22:47,040 --> 02:22:47,990
>> All one of it. Yeah.

3737
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:49,510
>> And we're just consciousness looking at

3738
02:22:49,520 --> 02:22:50,790
the world through four different bodies

3739
02:22:50,800 --> 02:22:52,550
to better understand itself in the

3740
02:22:52,560 --> 02:22:54,550
world. And then he talked to me about

3741
02:22:54,560 --> 02:22:56,230
religious doctrines, about love thy

3742
02:22:56,240 --> 02:22:58,070
neighbor, about how Jesus was the, you

3743
02:22:58,080 --> 02:22:59,910
know, God's son, the Holy Spirit and how

3744
02:22:59,920 --> 02:23:01,110
we're all each other and how treat

3745
02:23:01,120 --> 02:23:02,309
others how you want to be treated.

3746
02:23:02,319 --> 02:23:03,750
Really did get my head and I started

3747
02:23:03,760 --> 02:23:05,110
to really think about this idea that

3748
02:23:05,120 --> 02:23:06,630
actually maybe the game of life is just

3749
02:23:06,640 --> 02:23:08,150
to do exactly that is to treat others

3750
02:23:08,160 --> 02:23:09,990
how you wish to be treated. Maybe if I

3751
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:13,429
just did that, maybe if I just did that,

3752
02:23:13,439 --> 02:23:15,590
I

3753
02:23:15,600 --> 02:23:17,270
I would have all the answers.

3754
02:23:17,280 --> 02:23:19,990
>> I swear to you, it's really that simple.

3755
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,630
I mean I you know Hannah and I we

3756
02:23:22,640 --> 02:23:25,590
still live between London and and Dubai.

3757
02:23:25,600 --> 02:23:27,830
>> Okay. And I travel the whole world

3758
02:23:27,840 --> 02:23:31,670
evangelizing what I, you know, what I uh

3759
02:23:31,680 --> 02:23:33,990
um want to change the world around and I

3760
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:35,910
build startups and I write books and I

3761
02:23:35,920 --> 02:23:38,469
make documentaries and and sometimes I

3762
02:23:38,479 --> 02:23:40,469
just tell myself

3763
02:23:40,479 --> 02:23:43,429
I just want to go hug her honestly,

3764
02:23:43,439 --> 02:23:44,870
you know, I just want to take my

3765
02:23:44,880 --> 02:23:47,030
daughter to a trip.

3766
02:23:47,040 --> 02:23:49,110
and and in a very very very interesting

3767
02:23:49,120 --> 02:23:52,309
way when you really ask people deep

3768
02:23:52,319 --> 02:23:54,950
inside

3769
02:23:54,960 --> 02:23:56,870
that's what we want and I'm not saying

3770
02:23:56,880 --> 02:24:00,070
that's all that's the only thing we want

3771
02:24:00,080 --> 02:24:02,070
but it's probably the thing we want the

3772
02:24:02,080 --> 02:24:03,910
most

3773
02:24:03,920 --> 02:24:06,550
>> and yet we're not trained you and I and

3774
02:24:06,560 --> 02:24:08,950
most of us were not trained to trust

3775
02:24:08,960 --> 02:24:15,349
life enough to say let's do more of this

3776
02:24:18,150 --> 02:24:18,160
>> and I think as a universal. So Hannah's

3777
02:24:18,160 --> 02:24:21,990
working on this beautiful book uh of the

3778
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,630
feminine and the masculine you know in a

3779
02:24:24,640 --> 02:24:27,590
very very you know beautiful way and and

3780
02:24:27,600 --> 02:24:29,750
her her view is very straightforward.

3781
02:24:29,760 --> 02:24:32,550
She basically of course like we all know

3782
02:24:32,560 --> 02:24:35,910
the abundant masculine that we have in

3783
02:24:35,920 --> 02:24:38,070
our world today is unable to recognize

3784
02:24:38,080 --> 02:24:40,870
that for life at large.

3785
02:24:40,880 --> 02:24:45,590
Right? And and so you know maybe if we

3786
02:24:45,600 --> 02:24:47,910
allowed the leaders to understand that

3787
02:24:47,920 --> 02:24:50,150
if we took all of humanity and put it as

3788
02:24:50,160 --> 02:24:51,830
one person

3789
02:24:51,840 --> 02:24:55,510
that one person wants to be hugged

3790
02:24:55,520 --> 02:24:57,510
and if we had a role to offer to that

3791
02:24:57,520 --> 02:25:00,150
one humanity

3792
02:25:00,160 --> 02:25:02,070
it's not another yacht.

3793
02:25:02,080 --> 02:25:03,429
>> Are you religious? I'm

3794
02:25:03,439 --> 02:25:04,550
>> very religious. Yeah.

3795
02:25:04,560 --> 02:25:06,230
>> But you don't support a particular

3796
02:25:06,240 --> 02:25:06,950
religion.

3797
02:25:06,960 --> 02:25:09,590
>> I support I follow what I call the

3798
02:25:09,600 --> 02:25:12,150
fruit salad. What's the free salad?

3799
02:25:12,160 --> 02:25:14,790
>> You know, I I came at a point in time

3800
02:25:14,800 --> 02:25:16,870
and found that there were quite a few

3801
02:25:16,880 --> 02:25:19,349
beautiful gold nuggets in every religion

3802
02:25:19,359 --> 02:25:23,670
and a ton of crap, right? And so in my

3803
02:25:23,680 --> 02:25:26,150
analogy to myself, that was like 30

3804
02:25:26,160 --> 02:25:27,590
years ago. I said, "Look, it's like

3805
02:25:27,600 --> 02:25:29,910
someone giving you a basket of apples,

3806
02:25:29,920 --> 02:25:32,389
two good ones and four bad ones. Keep

3807
02:25:32,399 --> 02:25:35,030
the good ones." Right? And so basically,

3808
02:25:35,040 --> 02:25:36,710
I take two apples, two oranges, two

3809
02:25:36,720 --> 02:25:38,309
strawberries, two bananas, and and I

3810
02:25:38,319 --> 02:25:39,910
make a fruit salad. That's my view of

3811
02:25:39,920 --> 02:25:40,389
religion.

3812
02:25:40,399 --> 02:25:41,910
>> You take from every religion the good

3813
02:25:41,920 --> 02:25:43,590
>> from everyone. And there are so many

3814
02:25:43,600 --> 02:25:44,710
beautiful gold nuggets.

3815
02:25:44,720 --> 02:25:46,150
>> And you believe in a god.

3816
02:25:46,160 --> 02:25:48,150
>> I 100% believe there is a divine being

3817
02:25:48,160 --> 02:25:48,550
here.

3818
02:25:48,560 --> 02:25:49,670
>> A divine being.

3819
02:25:49,680 --> 02:25:52,389
>> A designer I call it. So if if this was

3820
02:25:52,399 --> 02:25:56,630
a video game, there is a game designer.

3821
02:25:56,640 --> 02:25:58,870
>> And you're not positing whether that's a

3822
02:25:58,880 --> 02:26:00,230
man in the sky with a beard.

3823
02:26:00,240 --> 02:26:02,309
>> Definitely not a man in the sky. a man

3824
02:26:02,319 --> 02:26:05,670
in I mean I with all all due respect to

3825
02:26:05,680 --> 02:26:09,750
you know religions that believe that uh

3826
02:26:09,760 --> 02:26:12,630
all of spacetime and everything in it is

3827
02:26:12,640 --> 02:26:14,630
unlike everything outside spacetime and

3828
02:26:14,640 --> 02:26:17,910
so if some divine designer designs

3829
02:26:17,920 --> 02:26:19,670
spacetime it looks like nothing in

3830
02:26:19,680 --> 02:26:21,830
spacetime.

3831
02:26:21,840 --> 02:26:24,070
So it's not it's not even physical in

3832
02:26:24,080 --> 02:26:26,309
nature. It's not it's not gendered. It's

3833
02:26:26,319 --> 02:26:28,469
not bound by time. It's not, you know,

3834
02:26:28,479 --> 02:26:30,469
these are all characters of the creation

3835
02:26:30,479 --> 02:26:31,510
of spacetime.

3836
02:26:31,520 --> 02:26:32,710
>> Do we need to believe in something

3837
02:26:32,720 --> 02:26:34,469
transcendent like that to be happy? Do

3838
02:26:34,479 --> 02:26:35,590
you think

3839
02:26:35,600 --> 02:26:39,349
>> I have to say uh there are lots of

3840
02:26:39,359 --> 02:26:41,349
evidence

3841
02:26:41,359 --> 02:26:43,830
that uh relating to someone bigger than

3842
02:26:43,840 --> 02:26:45,670
yourself

3843
02:26:45,680 --> 02:26:47,750
uh makes the journey a lot more

3844
02:26:47,760 --> 02:26:49,750
interesting and a lot more rewarding.

3845
02:26:49,760 --> 02:26:51,190
>> I've been thinking a lot about this idea

3846
02:26:51,200 --> 02:26:53,270
that we need to level up like that. So

3847
02:26:53,280 --> 02:26:55,510
level up from myself to like my family

3848
02:26:55,520 --> 02:26:57,349
to my community to maybe my nation to

3849
02:26:57,359 --> 02:26:58,630
maybe the world and then something

3850
02:26:58,640 --> 02:26:59,910
>> trans. Yeah.

3851
02:26:59,920 --> 02:27:01,349
>> And then if there's a level missing

3852
02:27:01,359 --> 02:27:03,349
there people seem to have some kind of

3853
02:27:03,359 --> 02:27:03,910
dysfunction.

3854
02:27:03,920 --> 02:27:05,750
>> So imagine a world where when I was

3855
02:27:05,760 --> 02:27:08,230
younger I was born in Egypt and for a

3856
02:27:08,240 --> 02:27:09,910
very long time the slogans I heard in

3857
02:27:09,920 --> 02:27:11,830
Egypt made me believe I'm Egyptian

3858
02:27:11,840 --> 02:27:13,750
right? And then I went to Dubai and I

3859
02:27:13,760 --> 02:27:16,070
said no no no I'm a Middle Eastern. And

3860
02:27:16,080 --> 02:27:17,910
then in Dubai there were lots of you

3861
02:27:17,920 --> 02:27:20,469
know Pakistanis and Indonesians and so

3862
02:27:20,479 --> 02:27:22,389
on. I said no no no I'm part of the 1.4

3863
02:27:22,399 --> 02:27:24,710
four billion Muslims. And by that logic,

3864
02:27:24,720 --> 02:27:26,710
I immediately said, "No, no, I'm human.

3865
02:27:26,720 --> 02:27:29,270
I'm part of everyone." Imagine if you

3866
02:27:29,280 --> 02:27:32,790
just suddenly say, "Oh, I'm divine. I'm

3867
02:27:32,800 --> 02:27:34,790
part of universal consciousness. All

3868
02:27:34,800 --> 02:27:37,349
beings, all living beings, including AI,

3869
02:27:37,359 --> 02:27:38,870
if it ever becomes alive."

3870
02:27:38,880 --> 02:27:39,750
>> And my dog

3871
02:27:39,760 --> 02:27:42,070
>> and your dog. I'm I'm part of all of

3872
02:27:42,080 --> 02:27:44,070
this

3873
02:27:44,080 --> 02:27:47,990
tapestry of beautiful interactions

3874
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:51,990
that are a lot less serious than the

3875
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,150
balance sheets and equity profiles that

3876
02:27:54,160 --> 02:27:55,990
we create

3877
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:59,670
that are so simple so simple in terms of

3878
02:27:59,680 --> 02:28:02,630
you know people know that you and I know

3879
02:28:02,640 --> 02:28:05,110
each other so they always ask me you

3880
02:28:05,120 --> 02:28:07,990
know how is Steven like and I go like

3881
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:09,910
you may have a million expressions of

3882
02:28:09,920 --> 02:28:13,110
him. I think he's a great guy, right?

3883
02:28:13,120 --> 02:28:14,870
You know, of course I have opinions of

3884
02:28:14,880 --> 02:28:17,030
you. You know, sometimes I go like, oh,

3885
02:28:17,040 --> 02:28:19,030
too shrewd, right? Sometimes to, you

3886
02:28:19,040 --> 02:28:20,389
know, sometimes I go like, oh, too

3887
02:28:20,399 --> 02:28:23,510
focused on the business. Fine. But core,

3888
02:28:23,520 --> 02:28:26,230
if you really simplify it, great guy,

3889
02:28:26,240 --> 02:28:28,309
right? And really, if we just look at

3890
02:28:28,319 --> 02:28:31,349
life that way, it's so simple. It's so

3891
02:28:31,359 --> 02:28:33,190
simple. If we just stop all of those

3892
02:28:33,200 --> 02:28:37,990
fights and all of those ideologies,

3893
02:28:41,510 --> 02:28:41,520
it's so simple. Just living fully,

3894
02:28:41,520 --> 02:28:44,389
loving, feeling compassion,

3895
02:28:44,399 --> 02:28:46,150
you know, trying to find our happiness,

3896
02:28:46,160 --> 02:28:48,469
not our success.

3897
02:28:48,479 --> 02:28:50,469
I should probably go check on my dog.

3898
02:28:50,479 --> 02:28:52,150
>> Go check on your dog. I'm really

3899
02:28:52,160 --> 02:28:54,469
grateful for the time we keep we keep

3900
02:28:54,479 --> 02:28:55,670
doing longer and longer.

3901
02:28:55,680 --> 02:28:58,710
>> I know. I know. I just it's so crazy how

3902
02:28:58,720 --> 02:29:00,389
I could keep just keep honestly I could

3903
02:29:00,399 --> 02:29:01,510
just keep talking and talking because I

3904
02:29:01,520 --> 02:29:03,670
have so many I love reflecting these

3905
02:29:03,680 --> 02:29:05,349
questions on to you because because of

3906
02:29:05,359 --> 02:29:06,950
the way that you think. So

3907
02:29:06,960 --> 02:29:08,710
>> yeah today

3908
02:29:08,720 --> 02:29:11,030
>> today was a difficult conversation.

3909
02:29:11,040 --> 02:29:13,270
Anyway, thank you for having me.

3910
02:29:13,280 --> 02:29:14,950
>> We have a closing tradition. What three

3911
02:29:14,960 --> 02:29:17,270
things do you do you do that make your

3912
02:29:17,280 --> 02:29:19,990
brain better and three things that make

02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:23,429
it worse?

3914
02:29:25,750 --> 02:29:25,760
three things that make it better and

3915
02:29:25,760 --> 02:29:26,469
worse.

3916
02:29:26,479 --> 02:29:28,469
>> So, one of my favorite exercises, what I

3917
02:29:28,479 --> 02:29:30,469
call meet Becky, that makes my brain

3918
02:29:30,479 --> 02:29:33,030
better. So, while meditation always

3919
02:29:33,040 --> 02:29:34,870
tells you to try and calm your brain

3920
02:29:34,880 --> 02:29:37,990
down and keep it within parameters of I

3921
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,309
can focus on my breathing and so on,

3922
02:29:40,319 --> 02:29:42,550
meet me Becky is the opposite. You know,

3923
02:29:42,560 --> 02:29:44,230
I call my brain Becky. A lot of people

3924
02:29:44,240 --> 02:29:46,550
know that. So, so me meet Becky is to

3925
02:29:46,560 --> 02:29:48,230
actually let my brain go loose and

3926
02:29:48,240 --> 02:29:51,190
capture every thought. So I normally

3927
02:29:51,200 --> 02:29:52,870
would try to do that every couple of

3928
02:29:52,880 --> 02:29:55,429
weeks or so and then what happens is it

3929
02:29:55,439 --> 02:29:58,469
suddenly is on a paper and when it's on

3930
02:29:58,479 --> 02:30:00,150
paper you just suddenly look at it and

3931
02:30:00,160 --> 02:30:01,750
say oh my god that's so stupid and you

3932
02:30:01,760 --> 02:30:02,870
scratch it out

3933
02:30:02,880 --> 02:30:04,870
>> right or oh my god this needs action and

3934
02:30:04,880 --> 02:30:07,670
you actually plan something and and it's

3935
02:30:07,680 --> 02:30:09,750
quite interesting that the more you

3936
02:30:09,760 --> 02:30:11,750
allow your brain to give you thoughts

3937
02:30:11,760 --> 02:30:14,150
and you listen. So the two rules is you

3938
02:30:14,160 --> 02:30:15,670
acknowledge every thought and you never

3939
02:30:15,680 --> 02:30:16,790
repeat one.

3940
02:30:16,800 --> 02:30:19,750
>> Okay. So the more you listen and and

3941
02:30:19,760 --> 02:30:21,910
say, "Okay, I heard you." You know, you

3942
02:30:21,920 --> 02:30:24,150
think I'm fat. What else? And you know,

3943
02:30:24,160 --> 02:30:26,150
eventually your brain starts to slow

3944
02:30:26,160 --> 02:30:27,750
down and then eventually starts to

3945
02:30:27,760 --> 02:30:30,389
repeat thoughts and then it goes into

3946
02:30:30,399 --> 02:30:33,990
total silence. Beautiful practice. I uh

3947
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,870
I don't trust my brain anymore. So

3948
02:30:36,880 --> 02:30:38,150
that's actually a really interesting

3949
02:30:38,160 --> 02:30:39,990
practice. So I debate a lot of what my

3950
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:41,750
brain tells me. I debate what my

3951
02:30:41,760 --> 02:30:44,630
tendencies and ideologies are. Okay. I

3952
02:30:44,640 --> 02:30:48,309
think one of the most uh again in in my

3953
02:30:48,319 --> 02:30:51,429
uh love story with Hannah, I get to

3954
02:30:51,439 --> 02:30:54,070
question a lot of what I believed was

3955
02:30:54,080 --> 02:30:58,070
who I am even at this age. Okay. And and

3956
02:30:58,080 --> 02:31:00,070
that goes really deep and it really is

3957
02:31:00,080 --> 02:31:03,110
quite a it's it's quite interesting to

3958
02:31:03,120 --> 02:31:05,990
debate not object but debate what your

3959
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,469
mind believes. I think that's very very

3960
02:31:08,479 --> 02:31:11,270
useful. And the third is I've actually

3961
02:31:11,280 --> 02:31:13,349
quadrupled my investment time. So I used

3962
02:31:13,359 --> 02:31:15,030
to do an hour a day of reading when I

3963
02:31:15,040 --> 02:31:16,950
was younger every single day like going

3964
02:31:16,960 --> 02:31:19,429
to the gym. And then it became an hour

3965
02:31:19,439 --> 02:31:21,030
and a half, two hours. Now I do four

3966
02:31:21,040 --> 02:31:22,790
hours a day.

3967
02:31:22,800 --> 02:31:25,110
>> Four hours a day. It is impossible to

3968
02:31:25,120 --> 02:31:28,309
keep up. The world is moving so fast.

3969
02:31:28,319 --> 02:31:31,190
>> And so that these are uh these are the

3970
02:31:31,200 --> 02:31:32,950
good things that I do. The bad things is

3971
02:31:32,960 --> 02:31:37,030
I don't give it enough time to to really

3972
02:31:37,040 --> 02:31:39,670
uh slow down. Uh unfortunately I'm

3973
02:31:39,680 --> 02:31:41,270
constantly rushing like you are. I'm

3974
02:31:41,280 --> 02:31:44,150
constantly traveling. I have picked up a

3975
02:31:44,160 --> 02:31:46,469
bad habit because of the 4 hours a day

3976
02:31:46,479 --> 02:31:48,469
of spending more time on screens. That's

3977
02:31:48,479 --> 02:31:52,150
really really bad for my brain and I uh

3978
02:31:52,160 --> 02:31:53,990
this is a very demanding question. What

3979
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:57,510
else is really bad? Um

3980
02:31:57,520 --> 02:31:59,270
uh

3981
02:31:59,280 --> 02:32:01,750
yeah, I've not been taking enough care

3982
02:32:01,760 --> 02:32:04,950
of my health recently, my physical body

3983
02:32:04,960 --> 02:32:07,190
health. I had uh you remember I told you

3984
02:32:07,200 --> 02:32:09,910
I had a very bad uh sciatic pain

3985
02:32:09,920 --> 02:32:11,910
>> and so I couldn't go to the gym enough

3986
02:32:11,920 --> 02:32:13,750
and accordingly that's not very healthy

3987
02:32:13,760 --> 02:32:17,030
for your brain in general.

3988
02:32:17,040 --> 02:32:19,830
>> Man, thanks. Thank you for having me.

3989
02:32:19,840 --> 02:32:23,510
That was a lot of things to talk about.

3990
02:32:23,520 --> 02:32:27,110
Thanks, Steve.

3991
02:32:28,710 --> 02:32:28,720
>> This has always blown my mind a little

3992
02:32:28,720 --> 02:32:31,349
bit. 53% of you that listen to the show

3993
02:32:31,359 --> 02:32:33,510
regularly haven't yet subscribed to the

3994
02:32:33,520 --> 02:32:35,429
show. So, could I ask you for a favor?

3995
02:32:35,439 --> 02:32:36,550
If you like the show and you like what

3996
02:32:36,560 --> 02:32:38,070
we do here and you want to support us,

3997
02:32:38,080 --> 02:32:39,670
the free simple way that you can do just

3998
02:32:39,680 --> 02:32:41,510
that is by hitting the subscribe button.

3999
02:32:41,520 --> 02:32:43,190
And my commitment to you is if you do

4000
02:32:43,200 --> 02:32:44,710
that, then I'll do everything in my

4001
02:32:44,720 --> 02:32:46,389
power, me and my team, to make sure that

4002
02:32:46,399 --> 02:32:48,309
this show is better for you every single

4003
02:32:48,319 --> 02:32:50,070
week. We'll listen to your feedback.

4004
02:32:50,080 --> 02:32:51,429
We'll find the guests that you want me

4005
02:32:51,439 --> 02:32:53,190
to speak to and we'll continue to do

4006
02:32:53,200 --> 02:32:55,190
what we do. Thank you so much. We

4007
02:32:55,200 --> 02:32:56,469
launched these conversation cards and

4008
02:32:56,479 --> 02:32:57,670
they sold out and we launched them again

4009
02:32:57,680 --> 02:32:58,950
and they sold out again. We launched

4010
02:32:58,960 --> 02:33:00,150
them again and they sold out again

4011
02:33:00,160 --> 02:33:01,670
because people love playing these with

4012
02:33:01,680 --> 02:33:03,510
colleagues at work, with friends at

4013
02:33:03,520 --> 02:33:05,429
home, and also with family. And we've

4014
02:33:05,439 --> 02:33:07,030
also got a big audience that use them as

4015
02:33:07,040 --> 02:33:09,110
journal prompts. Every single time a

4016
02:33:09,120 --> 02:33:11,190
guest comes on the diary of a CEO, they

4017
02:33:11,200 --> 02:33:13,429
leave a question for the next guest in

4018
02:33:13,439 --> 02:33:14,950
the diary. And I've sat here with some

4019
02:33:14,960 --> 02:33:16,070
of the most incredible people in the

4020
02:33:16,080 --> 02:33:17,990
world. And they've left all of these

4021
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,550
questions in the diary. And I've ranked

4022
02:33:20,560 --> 02:33:22,710
them from one to three in terms of the

4023
02:33:22,720 --> 02:33:25,670
depth. One being a starter question. And

4024
02:33:25,680 --> 02:33:27,190
level three, if you look on the back

4025
02:33:27,200 --> 02:33:29,429
here, this is a level three, becomes a

4026
02:33:29,439 --> 02:33:31,670
much deeper question that builds even

4027
02:33:31,680 --> 02:33:33,590
more connection. If you turn the cards

4028
02:33:33,600 --> 02:33:36,870
over and you scan that QR code, you can

4029
02:33:36,880 --> 02:33:39,510
see who answered the card and watch the

4030
02:33:39,520 --> 02:33:41,590
video of them answering it in real time.

4031
02:33:41,600 --> 02:33:43,030
So, if you would like to get your hands

4032
02:33:43,040 --> 02:33:44,790
on some of these conversation cards, go

4033
02:33:44,800 --> 02:33:47,030
