215
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,830
to change the course. Uh and we could at
the time I believe uh now I've changed

to hit a a short-term dystopia. There's

00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:56,640
to hit a a short-term dystopia. There's
 

221
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,750
to hit a a short-term dystopia. There's
no escaping that.

222
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:57,760
no escaping that.

>> What is dystopia?

224
00:03:59,270 --> 00:03:59,280
>> What is dystopia?
 

225
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,190
>> What is dystopia?
>> I call it face RIPs. We can talk about

226
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:01,200
>> I call it face RIPs. We can talk about
 

227
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,910
>> I call it face RIPs. We can talk about
it in details but the the the way we

228
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:03,920
it in details but the the the way we
 

229
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,670
it in details but the the the way we
define very important parameters in life

230
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:07,680
define very important parameters in life
 

231
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,789
define very important parameters in life
are going to be uh completely changed.

232
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:10,799
are going to be uh completely changed.
 

233
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,750
are going to be uh completely changed.
So so face RIPs are you know the way we

234
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:13,760
So so face RIPs are you know the way we
 

235
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,670
So so face RIPs are you know the way we
define freedom uh accountability human

236
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:17,680
define freedom uh accountability human
 

237
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,069
define freedom uh accountability human

00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:22,880
reality innovation and business and
 

241
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,710
reality innovation and business and
power. That's the first change. So the

242
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:24,720
power. That's the first change. So the
 

243
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,990
power. That's the first change. So the
first change in my mind is that uh is

244
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:28,000
first change in my mind is that uh is
 

245
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,390
first change in my mind is that uh is
that we uh will have to prepare for a

246
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:32,400
that we uh will have to prepare for a
 

247
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,030
that we uh will have to prepare for a
world that is very unfamiliar. Okay. And

248
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:35,040
world that is very unfamiliar. Okay. And
 

249
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,189
world that is very unfamiliar. Okay. And
that's the next 12 to 15 years. It has

250
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:37,199
that's the next 12 to 15 years. It has
 

251
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,870
that's the next 12 to 15 years. It has
already started. We've seen examples of

252
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:38,880
already started. We've seen examples of
 

253
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,230
already started. We've seen examples of
it in the world already even though

00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:40,240
it in the world already even though
 

255
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,070
it in the world already even though
people don't talk about it. I try to

256
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:42,080
people don't talk about it. I try to
 

257
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,469
people don't talk about it. I try to
tell people you know there are things we

258
00:04:44,469 --> 00:04:44,479
tell people you know there are things we
 

259
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,469
tell people you know there are things we
absolutely have to do. But on the other

260
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:46,479
absolutely have to do. But on the other
 

261
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,590
absolutely have to do. But on the other
hand I started to take an active role in

262
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:49,600
hand I started to take an active role in
 

263
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,990
hand I started to take an active role in
building amazing AIs. So AIS that will

264
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:54,000
building amazing AIs. So AIS that will
 

265
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,270
building amazing AIs. So AIS that will
uh not only make our world better uh but

266
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:57,280
uh not only make our world better uh but
 

267
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,390
uh not only make our world better uh but
that will understand us understand what

00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:00,400
that will understand us understand what
 

269
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,469
that will understand us understand what
humanity is through that process.

270
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:02,479
humanity is through that process.
 

271
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:03,909

so that we actually use AI to build the

so that we actually use AI to build the
 

323
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,350
so that we actually use AI to build the
utopia.

324

utopia.

that you now believe there'll be a

period of dystopia and to define the
 

331
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,670
period of dystopia and to define the
word dystopia, I've used AI, it says a

word dystopia, I've used AI, it says a
 

333
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,029
word dystopia, I've used AI, it says a
terrible society where people live under

terrible society where people live under
 

335
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,270
terrible society where people live under
fear, control or suffering and then you

fear, control or suffering and then you
 

337
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,029
fear, control or suffering and then you
think we'll come out of that dystopia

338
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:27,039
think we'll come out of that dystopia
 

339
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,270
think we'll come out of that dystopia
into a utopia which is defined as a

00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:29,280
into a utopia which is defined as a
 

341
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,029
into a utopia which is defined as a
perfect or ideal place where everything

perfect or ideal place where everything
 

343
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,790
perfect or ideal place where everything
works well, a good society where people

And the difference between them,

And the difference between them,
 

351
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,790
And the difference between them,
interestingly, is what I normally refer

352
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:38,800
interestingly, is what I normally refer
 

353
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,029
interestingly, is what I normally refer
to as the second dilemma, which is the

354
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:41,039
to as the second dilemma, which is the
 

355
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,749
to as the second dilemma, which is the
po point where we hand over completely

356
00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:43,759
po point where we hand over completely
 

357
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,029
po point where we hand over completely
to AI. So, a lot of people think that

358
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:47,039
to AI. So, a lot of people think that
 

359
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,790
to AI. So, a lot of people think that
when AI is in full control, it's going

360
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:48,800
when AI is in full control, it's going
 

361
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,270
when AI is in full control, it's going
to be an existential risk for humanity.

362
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:51,280
to be an existential risk for humanity.
 

363
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,150

You know, I have enough uh evidence to

You know, I have enough uh evidence to
 

365
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,150
You know, I have enough uh evidence to
to argue that when we fully hand over to

366
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:58,160
to argue that when we fully hand over to
 

367
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,710
to argue that when we fully hand over to
AI, that's going to be our salvation.

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,230

as humans is working against us. And I

as humans is working against us. And I

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,550
as humans is working against us. And I
think the challenges that will come from

think the challenges that will come from
 

379
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,990
think the challenges that will come from
humans being in control uh are going to

humans being in control uh are going to

outweigh the

outweigh the
 

383
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,950
outweigh the
the challenges that could come from AI

384
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:20,960
the challenges that could come from AI
 

385
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,230
the challenges that could come from AI
being in control.

386
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:22,240
being in control.
 

387
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,469

did you do you forecast the length of
 

391
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,749
did you do you forecast the length of
that dystopia? Yeah, I count I count it

392
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:29,759
that dystopia? Yeah, I count I count it
 

393
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,790
that dystopia? Yeah, I count I count it
exactly as 12 to 15 years. I believe

394
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:32,800
exactly as 12 to 15 years. I believe

the beginning of the slope will happen
 

397
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,469
the beginning of the slope will happen
in 2027. I mean it we will see signs in

398
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:38,479
in 2027. I mean it we will see signs in
 

399

26. We've seen signs in 24 but we will
see escalating signs next year and then

402
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:44,479
see escalating signs next year and then
 

403
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,830

And and you know the biggest lender uh
 

435
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,709

war. I mean think about it, huh? Uh the

the US, that's a result of a deep search
 

469

the US, that's a result of a deep search
with my AI Trixie. You know the current

470

with my AI Trixie. You know the current

24 to 26 trillion dollars to build. My

474
00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:21,839
24 to 26 trillion dollars to build. My
 

475
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,750
24 to 26 trillion dollars to build. My
conclusion is that a lot of the wars

476
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:23,760
conclusion is that a lot of the wars
 

477
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,110

00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:56,240
>> Okay. So, let me let me have a let me
 

551
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,230

have a go at this idea. So, the idea is

552
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:58,240
have a go at this idea. So, the idea is
 

553
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,550
have a go at this idea. So, the idea is
that really money is driving a lot of

554

that really money is driving a lot of
 

555
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,990
that really money is driving a lot of
the conflict we're seeing and it's

556
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:02,000
the conflict we're seeing and it's
 

557
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,069
the conflict we're seeing and it's
really going to be driving the dystopia.

558
00:11:04,069 --> 00:11:04,079
really going to be driving the dystopia.
 

559
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,910
really going to be driving the dystopia.
So, here's an idea. So, I um I was

560
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:05,920
So, here's an idea. So, I um I was
 

561
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,269
So, here's an idea. So, I um I was
reading something the other day and it

562
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:07,279
reading something the other day and it
 

563
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,590
reading something the other day and it
talked about how

564
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:09,600
talked about how
 

565
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,069
talked about how
billionaires are never satisfied because

566
00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:12,079
billionaires are never satisfied because
 

567
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,949
billionaires are never satisfied because
actually what a billionaire wants isn't

568
00:11:14,949 --> 00:11:14,959
actually what a billionaire wants isn't
 

569
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,670
actually what a billionaire wants isn't
actually more money. It is more status.

570
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:17,680
actually more money. It is more status.
 

571
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,509
actually more money. It is more status.
Correct. And I was looking at the sort

572
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:19,519
Correct. And I was looking at the sort
 

573
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,670
Correct. And I was looking at the sort
of evolutionary case for this argument.

574
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:21,680
of evolutionary case for this argument.
 

575
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,350
of evolutionary case for this argument.
And if you go back a couple of thousand

576
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:23,360
And if you go back a couple of thousand
 

577
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,430
And if you go back a couple of thousand
years,

578
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:25,440
years,
 

579
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,990
years,
money didn't exist. You were as wealthy

580
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,000
money didn't exist. You were as wealthy
 

581
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,230
money didn't exist. You were as wealthy
as what you could carry. So even I think

582
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:30,240
as what you could carry. So even I think
 

583
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,710
as what you could carry. So even I think
to the human mind, the idea of wealth

584
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:32,720
to the human mind, the idea of wealth
 

585
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,110
to the human mind, the idea of wealth
and money

586
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:35,120
and money
 

587
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,430
and money
isn't a thing. what we've but what has

588
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:37,440
isn't a thing. what we've but what has
 

589
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,430
isn't a thing. what we've but what has
always mattered from a survival of the

590
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:39,440
always mattered from a survival of the
 

591
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,670
always mattered from a survival of the
fittest from a reproductive standpoint

592
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:41,680
fittest from a reproductive standpoint
 

593
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,150
fittest from a reproductive standpoint
what's always had reproductive value if

594
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:44,160
what's always had reproductive value if
 

595
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,470
what's always had reproductive value if
you go back thousands of years the

596
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:46,480
you go back thousands of years the
 

597
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,710
you go back thousands of years the
person who was able to mate the most was

598
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:48,720
person who was able to mate the most was
 

599
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,350
person who was able to mate the most was
the person with the most status so it

600
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:51,360
the person with the most status so it
 

601
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,389
the person with the most status so it
makes the case the reason why

602
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:52,399
makes the case the reason why
 

603
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,750
makes the case the reason why
billionaires get all of this money but

604

next threat is coming from. Okay, and
 

729
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,590
next threat is coming from. Okay, and
this happens not only in war but also in

730
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:17,600
this happens not only in war but also in
 

731
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,389
this happens not only in war but also in
economics. Okay, also in innovation,

economics. Okay, also in innovation,
 

733
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,150

also in technology and so on and so

734
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:22,160
also in technology and so on and so
 

735
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,550
also in technology and so on and so
forth, right? And so basically what that

736
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:24,560
forth, right? And so basically what that
 

737
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,509
forth, right? And so basically what that
means is that like you rightly said as

738
00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:27,519
means is that like you rightly said as
 

739
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,350
means is that like you rightly said as

They want to make sure that as soon as
they get to AGI that nobody else has AGI

746
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:37,920
they get to AGI that nobody else has AGI
 

747
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,629
they get to AGI that nobody else has AGI
and and basically they want to make sure

748
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:40,639
and and basically they want to make sure
 

749
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,590
and and basically they want to make sure
that nobody else has the ability to

750
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:43,600
that nobody else has the ability to
 

751
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,069
that nobody else has the ability to
shake their position of privilege if you

752
00:14:46,069 --> 00:14:46,079
shake their position of privilege if you
 

753
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,550
shake their position of privilege if you
want. Okay. And so you're going to see a

754
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:48,560
want. Okay. And so you're going to see a
 

755

because they say, "Oh, but the cost of a
product also includes raw materials and

1274
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:03,520
product also includes raw materials and
 

1275
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,270
product also includes raw materials and
factories and so on and so forth." All

1276
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:05,280
factories and so on and so forth." All
 

1277
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,510
factories and so on and so forth." All
of that is built is built by labor,

1278
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:07,520
of that is built is built by labor,
 

1279
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,830
of that is built is built by labor,
right? So, so basically labor goes and

1280
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:09,840
right? So, so basically labor goes and
 

1281
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,430
right? So, so basically labor goes and
mines for the material and then the

1282
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:11,440
mines for the material and then the
 

1283
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,789
mines for the material and then the
material is sold for a little bit of

1284
00:24:12,789 --> 00:24:12,799
material is sold for a little bit of
 

1285
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,870
material is sold for a little bit of
margin then that material is turned into

1286
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:14,880
margin then that material is turned into
 

1287
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,390
margin then that material is turned into
a machine. It's sold for a little bit of

1288
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:16,400
a machine. It's sold for a little bit of
 

1289
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,149
a machine. It's sold for a little bit of
margin then that machine and so on.

1290
00:24:18,149 --> 00:24:18,159
margin then that machine and so on.
 

1291
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,549

Okay, there's always labor arbitrage in

00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:20,559
Okay, there's always labor arbitrage in
 

1293

Okay, there's always labor arbitrage in
a world where humanity's minds are being

00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,310
automation he had was a spear. The
farmer had way more automation. And the

1446
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:20,320
farmer had way more automation. And the
 

1447
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,870
farmer had way more automation. And the
biggest automation was what? The soil.

1448
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:22,880
biggest automation was what? The soil.
 

1449
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,870
biggest automation was what? The soil.
The soil did most of the work. The

00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:24,880
The soil did most of the work. The

00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,430
again I'm paraphrasing here. I will put
it on the screen. We have this community

moment in time where he tried to take it

2358
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:05,520
moment in time where he tried to take it
 

2359
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,670
moment in time where he tried to take it
back and you know the board rejected it

2360
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:07,680
back and you know the board rejected it
 

2361
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,550
back and you know the board rejected it
or some something like that. most of the

2362
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:10,560

2363
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,750

00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:13,760
uh top um safety engineers, the top
 

2365
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:17,750

2369
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,510
2024 openly saying we're not concerned
with safety anymore. It moves from being

2370
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:23,520
with safety anymore. It moves from being
 

2371
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,829

a nonforprofit to being one of the most

2667
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,710
socialism. The ideology of giving
everyone what they need. That's not the

2668
00:51:38,710 --> 00:51:38,720
everyone what they need. That's not the
 

2669
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,230
everyone what they need. That's not the
capitalist

2670
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:40,240
capitalist
 

2671
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,069
capitalist
democratic society that the west

2672
00:51:42,069 --> 00:51:42,079
democratic society that the west
 

2673
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:45,190
democratic society that the west
advocates. So those transitions are

2674
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:45,200
advocates. So those transitions are
 

2675
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,510
advocates. So those transitions are
massive in magnitude.

2676
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:47,520
massive in magnitude.
 

2677
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:50,390
massive in magnitude.
And for those transitions to happen, I

2678
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:50,400
And for those transitions to happen, I
 

2679
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,710
And for those transitions to happen, I
believe the right thing to do when the

2680
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:52,720
believe the right thing to do when the
 

2681
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:55,109
believe the right thing to do when the
cost of producing everything is almost

2682
00:51:55,109 --> 00:51:55,119
cost of producing everything is almost
 

2683
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:57,990
cost of producing everything is almost
zero because of AI and robots.

2684
00:51:57,990 --> 00:51:58,000
zero because of AI and robots.
 

2685
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,309
zero because of AI and robots.
because the cost of harvesting energy

2686
00:52:00,309 --> 00:52:00,319
because the cost of harvesting energy
 

2687
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:02,390
because the cost of harvesting energy
should actually tend to zero once we get

2688
00:52:02,390 --> 00:52:02,400
should actually tend to zero once we get
 

2689
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,470
should actually tend to zero once we get
more intelligent to harvest the energy

2690
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:04,480
more intelligent to harvest the energy
 

2691
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:07,510
more intelligent to harvest the energy
out of thin air. Then a possible

2692
00:52:07,510 --> 00:52:07,520
out of thin air. Then a possible
 

2693
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,589
out of thin air. Then a possible
scenario and and I believe a scenario

2694
00:52:09,589 --> 00:52:09,599
scenario and and I believe a scenario
 

2695
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:13,349
scenario and and I believe a scenario
that AI will eventually do in the utopia

2696
00:52:13,349 --> 00:52:13,359
that AI will eventually do in the utopia
 

2697
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:15,910
that AI will eventually do in the utopia
is yeah anyone can get anything they

2698
00:52:15,910 --> 00:52:15,920
is yeah anyone can get anything they
 

2699
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,750
is yeah anyone can get anything they
want. Don't over consume. We're not

2700
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:17,760
want. Don't over consume. We're not
 

2701
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,230
want. Don't over consume. We're not
going to abuse the the planet resources

2702
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:20,240
going to abuse the the planet resources
 

2703
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,950
going to abuse the the planet resources
but it costs nothing. So like the old

2704
00:52:22,950 --> 00:52:22,960
but it costs nothing. So like the old
 

2705
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:25,109
but it costs nothing. So like the old
days where we were hunter gatherers, you

2706
00:52:25,109 --> 00:52:25,119
days where we were hunter gatherers, you
 

2707
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:27,510
days where we were hunter gatherers, you
would, you know, forge for some berries

2708
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:27,520
would, you know, forge for some berries
 

2709
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:30,470
would, you know, forge for some berries
and you'll find them ready in in nature.

2710
00:52:30,470 --> 00:52:30,480
and you'll find them ready in in nature.
 

2711
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,750
and you'll find them ready in in nature.
Okay, we can in 10 years time, 12 years

2712
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:33,760
Okay, we can in 10 years time, 12 years
 

2713
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:36,950
Okay, we can in 10 years time, 12 years
time build a society where you can forge

2714
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:36,960
time build a society where you can forge
 

2715
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,190
time build a society where you can forge
for an iPhone in nature. It will be made

2716
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:39,200
for an iPhone in nature. It will be made
 

2717
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,510
for an iPhone in nature. It will be made
out of thin air. Nanopysics will allow

2718
00:52:41,510 --> 00:52:41,520
out of thin air. Nanopysics will allow
 

2719
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:44,790
out of thin air. Nanopysics will allow
you to do that. Okay? But the challenge,

2720
00:52:44,790 --> 00:52:44,800
you to do that. Okay? But the challenge,
 

2721
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,790
you to do that. Okay? But the challenge,
believe it or not, is not tech. The

2722
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:46,800
believe it or not, is not tech. The
 

2723
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,870
believe it or not, is not tech. The
challenge is a mindset. Because the

2724
00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:48,880
challenge is a mindset. Because the
 

2725
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:51,829
challenge is a mindset. Because the
elite, why would they give you that for

2726
00:52:51,829 --> 00:52:51,839
elite, why would they give you that for
 

2727
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:55,030
elite, why would they give you that for
free? Okay. And the system would morph

2728
00:52:55,030 --> 00:52:55,040
free? Okay. And the system would morph
 

2729
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,589
free? Okay. And the system would morph
into, no, no, hold on. We will make more

2730
00:52:57,589 --> 00:52:57,599
into, no, no, hold on. We will make more
 

2731
00:52:57,599 --> 00:52:59,829
into, no, no, hold on. We will make more
money. We will be bigger capitalists. We

2732
00:52:59,829 --> 00:52:59,839
money. We will be bigger capitalists. We
 

2733
00:52:59,839 --> 00:53:02,069
money. We will be bigger capitalists. We
will feed our ego and hunger for power

2734
00:53:02,069 --> 00:53:02,079
will feed our ego and hunger for power
 

2735
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:05,670
will feed our ego and hunger for power
more and more. And for them, give them

2736
00:53:05,670 --> 00:53:05,680
more and more. And for them, give them
 

2737
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,390
more and more. And for them, give them
UBI and then 3 weeks later give them

2738
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:08,400
UBI and then 3 weeks later give them
 

2739
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:09,430
UBI and then 3 weeks later give them
less UBI.

2740
00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:09,440
less UBI.
 

2741
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:10,790
less UBI.

What the West publicly said at the time

00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,309
What the West publicly said at the time
is we're we're going to be a services

2790
00:54:06,309 --> 00:54:06,319
is we're we're going to be a services

that. We're going to do more refined
 

2801
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:18,950

I give you a piece of land, I give the
 

2823
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:48,470
I give you a piece of land, I give the
AI a piece of land and I say here are

00:54:48,470 --> 00:54:48,480
AI a piece of land and I say here are
 

2825
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,230
AI a piece of land and I say here are
the parameters of my land. Here is its

2826
00:54:50,230 --> 00:54:50,240
the parameters of my land. Here is its
 

2827
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:53,190
the parameters of my land. Here is its
location on Google maps. Design an

2828
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:53,200
location on Google maps. Design an
 

2829
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,510
location on Google maps. Design an
architecturally sound villa for me. I

2830
00:54:55,510 --> 00:54:55,520
architecturally sound villa for me. I
 

2831
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:57,670
architecturally sound villa for me. I
care about a lot of light and I need

2832
00:54:57,670 --> 00:54:57,680
care about a lot of light and I need
 

2833
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,829
care about a lot of light and I need
three bedrooms. I want my bathrooms to

2834
00:54:59,829 --> 00:54:59,839
three bedrooms. I want my bathrooms to
 

2835
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:02,710
three bedrooms. I want my bathrooms to
be in white marble, whatever. And the AI

2836
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:02,720
be in white marble, whatever. And the AI
 

2837
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,470
be in white marble, whatever. And the AI
produces it like that. How often will

2838
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:04,480
produces it like that. How often will
 

2839
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:09,109
produces it like that. How often will
you go to an to an architect and say

2840
00:55:09,109 --> 00:55:09,119
you go to an to an architect and say
 

2841
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:12,390
you go to an to an architect and say
right so what will the architect do the

2842
00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:12,400
right so what will the architect do the
 

2843
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,230
right so what will the architect do the
best of the best of the architects will

2844
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:14,240
best of the best of the architects will
 

2845
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:16,710
best of the best of the architects will
either use AI to produce that or you

2846
00:55:16,710 --> 00:55:16,720
either use AI to produce that or you
 

2847
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:19,030
either use AI to produce that or you
will consult with them and say hey you

2848
00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:19,040
will consult with them and say hey you
 

2849
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,589
will consult with them and say hey you
know I've seen this and they'll say it's

2850
00:55:21,589 --> 00:55:21,599
know I've seen this and they'll say it's
 

2851
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:23,910
know I've seen this and they'll say it's
really pretty but it wouldn't feel right

2852
00:55:23,910 --> 00:55:23,920
really pretty but it wouldn't feel right
 

2853
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,150
really pretty but it wouldn't feel right
for the person that you are yeah those

2854
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:26,160
for the person that you are yeah those
 

2855
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:27,670
for the person that you are yeah those
jobs will remain but how many of them

2856
00:55:27,670 --> 00:55:27,680
jobs will remain but how many of them
 

2857
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,750
jobs will remain but how many of them
will remain

2858
00:55:29,750 --> 00:55:29,760
will remain
 

2859
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:32,950
will remain
how how often do you think uh how many

2860
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:32,960
how how often do you think uh how many
 

2861
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,790
how how often do you think uh how many
more years. Do you think I will be able

2862
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:34,800
more years. Do you think I will be able
 

2863
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,710
more years. Do you think I will be able
to create a book that is smarter than

2864
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:36,720
to create a book that is smarter than
 

2865
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:40,390
to create a book that is smarter than
AI?

2866
00:55:40,390 --> 00:55:40,400

 

2867
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:43,030

Not many. I will still be able to

2868
00:55:43,030 --> 00:55:43,040
Not many. I will still be able to
 

2869
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,870
Not many. I will still be able to
connect to a human. You're not going to

2870
00:55:44,870 --> 00:55:44,880
connect to a human. You're not going to
 

2871
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,950
connect to a human. You're not going to
hug an AI when you meet them like you

2872
00:55:46,950 --> 00:55:46,960
hug an AI when you meet them like you
 

2873
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:50,230
hug an AI when you meet them like you
hug me, right? But that's not enough of

2874
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:50,240
hug me, right? But that's not enough of
 

2875
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,789
hug me, right? But that's not enough of
a job.

2876
00:55:52,789 --> 00:55:52,799
a job.
 

2877
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:54,950
a job.
So why do I say that? Remember I asked

2878
00:55:54,950 --> 00:55:54,960
So why do I say that? Remember I asked
 

2879
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,870
So why do I say that? Remember I asked
you at the beginning of the podcast to

2880
00:55:56,870 --> 00:55:56,880
you at the beginning of the podcast to
 

2881
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,829
you at the beginning of the podcast to
remind me of solutions. Why do I say

2882
00:55:59,829 --> 00:55:59,839
remind me of solutions. Why do I say
 

2883
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:02,630
remind me of solutions. Why do I say
that? Because there are ideological

2884
00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:02,640
that? Because there are ideological
 

2885
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:05,589
that? Because there are ideological
shifts and and concrete actions that

2886
00:56:05,589 --> 00:56:05,599
shifts and and concrete actions that
 

2887
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:07,990
shifts and and concrete actions that
need to be taken by governments today

2888
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:08,000
need to be taken by governments today
 

2889
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,069
need to be taken by governments today
rather than waiting until COVID is

2890
00:56:10,069 --> 00:56:10,079
rather than waiting until COVID is
 

2891
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:11,670
rather than waiting until COVID is
already everywhere and then locking

2892
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:11,680
already everywhere and then locking
 

2893
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:13,990
already everywhere and then locking
everyone down. Governments could have

2894
00:56:13,990 --> 00:56:14,000
everyone down. Governments could have
 

2895
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,230
everyone down. Governments could have
reacted before the first patient or at

2896
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:16,240
reacted before the first patient or at
 

2897
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,309
reacted before the first patient or at
least at patient zero or at least at

2898
00:56:18,309 --> 00:56:18,319
least at patient zero or at least at
 

2899
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:21,270
least at patient zero or at least at
patient 50. They didn't. H what I'm

2900
00:56:21,270 --> 00:56:21,280
patient 50. They didn't. H what I'm
 

2901
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:24,630
patient 50. They didn't. H what I'm
trying to say is there is no doubt that

2902
00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:24,640
trying to say is there is no doubt that
 

2903
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:27,349
trying to say is there is no doubt that
lots of jobs will be lost. There's no

2904
00:56:27,349 --> 00:56:27,359
lots of jobs will be lost. There's no
 

2905
00:56:27,359 --> 00:56:29,190
lots of jobs will be lost. There's no
doubt that there will be sectors of

2906
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:29,200
doubt that there will be sectors of
 

2907
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:33,990
doubt that there will be sectors of
society where 10 20 30 40 50% of all

2908
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:34,000
society where 10 20 30 40 50% of all

are going to be out of a job. So are we

2916
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:46,720
are going to be out of a job. So are we
 

2917
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,630
are going to be out of a job. So are we
prepared as a society to do that? Can we

2918
00:56:48,630 --> 00:56:48,640
prepared as a society to do that? Can we
 

2919
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:50,390
prepared as a society to do that? Can we
tell our governments there is an

2920
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:50,400
tell our governments there is an
 

2921
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,870
tell our governments there is an
ideological shift? This is very close to

2922
00:56:52,870 --> 00:56:52,880
ideological shift? This is very close to
 

2923
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:55,349
ideological shift? This is very close to
social socialism and and communism.

2924
00:56:55,349 --> 00:56:55,359
social socialism and and communism.
 

2925
00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:58,470
social socialism and and communism.
Okay. And are we ready from a budget

2926
00:56:58,470 --> 00:56:58,480
Okay. And are we ready from a budget
 

2927
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:00,950
Okay. And are we ready from a budget
point of view instead of spending a a

2928
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:00,960
point of view instead of spending a a
 

2929
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,510
point of view instead of spending a a
trillion dollars a year on on arms and

2930
00:57:03,510 --> 00:57:03,520
trillion dollars a year on on arms and
 

2931
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:06,549
trillion dollars a year on on arms and
and explosives and you know autonomous

2932
00:57:06,549 --> 00:57:06,559
and explosives and you know autonomous
 

2933
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:08,630
and explosives and you know autonomous
weapons that will oppress people because

2934
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:08,640
weapons that will oppress people because
 

2935
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:11,670
weapons that will oppress people because
we can't feed them? Can we please shift

2936
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:11,680
we can't feed them? Can we please shift
 

2937
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:14,470
we can't feed them? Can we please shift
that? I did those numbers. Huh. Uh again

2938
00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:14,480
that? I did those numbers. Huh. Uh again
 

2939
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,470
that? I did those numbers. Huh. Uh again
I go back to military spending because

2940
00:57:16,470 --> 00:57:16,480
I go back to military spending because
 

2941
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:21,109
I go back to military spending because
it's all around us. 2.71 trillion. 2.4

2942
00:57:21,109 --> 00:57:21,119
it's all around us. 2.71 trillion. 2.4
 

2943
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:24,309
it's all around us. 2.71 trillion. 2.4
to2.7 is the estimate of 2024. how much

2944
00:57:24,309 --> 00:57:24,319
to2.7 is the estimate of 2024. how much
 

2945
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:25,990
to2.7 is the estimate of 2024. how much
money we're spending on military

2946
00:57:25,990 --> 00:57:26,000
money we're spending on military
 

2947
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,829
money we're spending on military
>> on Yeah. on military equipment on things

2948
00:57:27,829 --> 00:57:27,839
>> on Yeah. on military equipment on things
 

2949
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:30,710
>> on Yeah. on military equipment on things
that we're going to explode into smoke

2950
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:30,720
that we're going to explode into smoke
 

2951
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:33,430
that we're going to explode into smoke
and death. Extreme poverty worldwide.

2952
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:33,440
and death. Extreme poverty worldwide.
 

2953
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:35,030
and death. Extreme poverty worldwide.
Extreme poverty is people that are below

2954
00:57:35,030 --> 00:57:35,040
Extreme poverty is people that are below
 

2955
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,589
Extreme poverty is people that are below
the poverty line. Extreme poverty

2956
00:57:37,589 --> 00:57:37,599
the poverty line. Extreme poverty
 

2957
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:39,990
the poverty line. Extreme poverty
everywhere in the world could end for 10

2958
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:40,000
everywhere in the world could end for 10
 

2959
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,789
everywhere in the world could end for 10
to 12% of that budget. So if we replace

2960
00:57:42,789 --> 00:57:42,799
to 12% of that budget. So if we replace
 

2961
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:46,549
to 12% of that budget. So if we replace
our military spending 10% of that to go

2962
00:57:46,549 --> 00:57:46,559
our military spending 10% of that to go
 

2963
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:48,150
our military spending 10% of that to go
to people who are in extreme poverty,

2964
00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:48,160
to people who are in extreme poverty,
 

2965
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:50,150
to people who are in extreme poverty,
nobody will be poor in the world. Okay.

2966
00:57:50,150 --> 00:57:50,160
nobody will be poor in the world. Okay.
 

2967
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:54,230
nobody will be poor in the world. Okay.
You can end uh world hunger for less

2968
00:57:54,230 --> 00:57:54,240
You can end uh world hunger for less
 

2969
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,870
You can end uh world hunger for less
than 4%. Nobody would be hungry in the

2970
00:57:56,870 --> 00:57:56,880
than 4%. Nobody would be hungry in the
 

2971
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,589
than 4%. Nobody would be hungry in the
world. You know, if you take uh again 10

2972
00:57:59,589 --> 00:57:59,599
world. You know, if you take uh again 10
 

2973
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:03,270
world. You know, if you take uh again 10
to 12% universal healthcare, every human

2974
00:58:03,270 --> 00:58:03,280
to 12% universal healthcare, every human
 

2975
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:05,270
to 12% universal healthcare, every human
being on the planet would have free

2976
00:58:05,270 --> 00:58:05,280
being on the planet would have free
 

2977

spending on war. Now, why why do I say
 

2981
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,630

this when we're talking about AI?

00:58:12,630 --> 00:58:12,640
this when we're talking about AI?

this when we're talking about AI?
Because that's a simple decision. If we

dead in the eye and told me that I I

3452
01:06:17,190 --> 01:06:17,200
dead in the eye and told me that I I
 

3453
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:18,230

should train to be a plumber.

3454

should train to be a plumber.
 

3455
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:23,109
should train to be a plumber.
>> 100%. So so so uh it's funny uh machines

3456
01:06:23,109 --> 01:06:23,119
>> 100%. So so so uh it's funny uh machines
 

3457

replaced labor but we still had blue

3458
01:06:25,270 --> 01:06:25,280
replaced labor but we still had blue
 

3459
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:28,150
replaced labor but we still had blue
collar. Then uh you know the refined

3460
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:28,160
collar. Then uh you know the refined
 

3461
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:30,230
collar. Then uh you know the refined
jobs became white collar information

3462
01:06:30,230 --> 01:06:30,240
jobs became white collar information
 

3463
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:30,789
jobs became white collar information
workers.

01:06:30,789 --> 01:06:30,799
workers.
 

3465
01:06:30,799 --> 01:06:32,150

>> What's the refined jobs?

3466
01:06:32,150 --> 01:06:32,160
>> What's the refined jobs?
 

3467
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:33,750

01:06:38,390 --> 01:06:38,400
You know you sit in an in an office and
 

3473
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,549
You know you sit in an in an office and
sit in meetings all day and blabber, you

sit in meetings all day and blabber, you
 

3475
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:42,309
sit in meetings all day and blabber, you
know, useless shit then that's your

know, useless shit then that's your
 

3477
01:06:42,319 --> 01:06:45,829
know, useless shit then that's your
job. Okay? And those jobs, funny enough,

3478
01:06:45,829 --> 01:06:45,839
job. Okay? And those jobs, funny enough,
 

3479
01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:48,549
job. Okay? And those jobs, funny enough,
in the reverse of that, because robotics

3480
01:06:48,549 --> 01:06:48,559
in the reverse of that, because robotics
 

3481
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:51,190
in the reverse of that, because robotics
are not ready yet. Okay. And I believe

3482
01:06:51,190 --> 01:06:51,200

3483
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:52,630

they're not ready because of a
 

3485
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:55,270
they're not ready because of a
stubbornness on the on the robotics

3497
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,990

more robots that don't look like a human

3498
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:08,000
more robots that don't look like a human
 

3499
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,510
more robots that don't look like a human
just like a self-driving car in

01:07:09,510 --> 01:07:09,520
just like a self-driving car in
 

3501
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:12,549
just like a self-driving car in
California. Okay, that that does already

3502
01:07:12,549 --> 01:07:12,559
California. Okay, that that does already
 

3503
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:15,589
California. Okay, that that does already
replace drivers and and you know but but

3504
01:07:15,589 --> 01:07:15,599
replace drivers and and you know but but
 

3505
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:17,910
replace drivers and and you know but but
they're delayed. So the robotic the the

3506
01:07:17,910 --> 01:07:17,920
they're delayed. So the robotic the the
 

3507
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:21,349
they're delayed. So the robotic the the
replacement of physical manual labor is

3508
01:07:21,349 --> 01:07:21,359
replacement of physical manual labor is
 

3509
01:07:21,359 --> 01:07:23,829
replacement of physical manual labor is
going to take four to five years before

3510
01:07:23,829 --> 01:07:23,839
going to take four to five years before
 

3511
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:26,390

now and when that happens it's going to
 

3517
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:35,430
now and when that happens it's going to
take a long cycle to manufacture enough

take a long cycle to manufacture enough
 

3519

take a long cycle to manufacture enough
robots so that they replace all of those

robots so that they replace all of those
 

3521
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:40,150
robots so that they replace all of those
jobs. that cycle will take longer. Blue

to schedule something like this today, I
 

3595
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:10,470
to schedule something like this today, I
just copy the AI in and it looks at your

3596
01:09:10,470 --> 01:09:10,480
just copy the AI in and it looks at your

calendar looks at mine and schedules it
 

3599
01:09:11,839 --> 01:09:13,590
calendar looks at mine and schedules it
for for us. So there might not be

3600
01:09:13,590 --> 01:09:13,600
for for us. So there might not be
 

3601
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,510
for for us. So there might not be
scheduling needs, but my dog is sick at

3602
01:09:15,510 --> 01:09:15,520
scheduling needs, but my dog is sick at
 

3603
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:17,349
scheduling needs, but my dog is sick at
the moment. And as I left this morning,

3604
01:09:17,349 --> 01:09:17,359
the moment. And as I left this morning,
 

3605
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:18,709
the moment. And as I left this morning,
I was like, damn, he's like really sick

3606
01:09:18,709 --> 01:09:18,719
I was like, damn, he's like really sick
 

3607
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:19,990
I was like, damn, he's like really sick
and I've taken him to the vet over and

3608
01:09:19,990 --> 01:09:20,000
and I've taken him to the vet over and
 

3609
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,269
and I've taken him to the vet over and
over again. I really need someone to

3610
01:09:21,269 --> 01:09:21,279
over again. I really need someone to
 

3611
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:23,269
over again. I really need someone to
look after him and figure out what's

3612
01:09:23,269 --> 01:09:23,279
look after him and figure out what's
 

3613
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:25,110
look after him and figure out what's
wrong with him. So those kinds of

3614
01:09:25,110 --> 01:09:25,120
wrong with him. So those kinds of
 

3615
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:28,309
wrong with him. So those kinds of
responsibilities of like care. I don't

3616
01:09:28,309 --> 01:09:28,319
responsibilities of like care. I don't
 

3617
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:30,550
responsibilities of like care. I don't
disagree at all. Again, all

3618
01:09:30,550 --> 01:09:30,560
disagree at all. Again, all
 

3619
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:33,590
disagree at all. Again, all

01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:34,480
don't know how to say this in a nice
 

3623
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:35,990
don't know how to say this in a nice
way, but my assistants will still have

01:09:35,990 --> 01:09:36,000
way, but my assistants will still have
 

3625
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:39,910
way, but my assistants will still have
their jobs, but I as a CEO will be

3626
01:09:39,910 --> 01:09:39,920
their jobs, but I as a CEO will be
 

3627
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:41,510
their jobs, but I as a CEO will be
asking them to do a different type of

3628
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:41,520
asking them to do a different type of
 

3629
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:42,309
asking them to do a different type of
work.

3630
01:09:42,309 --> 01:09:42,319
work.
 

3631
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:44,309
work.
>> Correct. So, so, so this is the

3632
01:09:44,309 --> 01:09:44,319
>> Correct. So, so, so this is the
 

3633
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:45,910
>> Correct. So, so, so this is the
calculation everyone needs to be aware

3634
01:09:45,910 --> 01:09:45,920
calculation everyone needs to be aware
 

3635
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:48,870
calculation everyone needs to be aware
of that a lot of their current

3636
01:09:48,870 --> 01:09:48,880
of that a lot of their current
 

3637
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:50,390
of that a lot of their current
responsibility, whoever you are, if

3638
01:09:50,390 --> 01:09:50,400
responsibility, whoever you are, if
 

3639
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:52,789
responsibility, whoever you are, if
you're a parallegal, if you're whatever,

3640
01:09:52,789 --> 01:09:52,799
you're a parallegal, if you're whatever,
 

3641
01:09:52,799 --> 01:09:55,830
you're a parallegal, if you're whatever,
will be handed over. So, so let me

3642
01:09:55,830 --> 01:09:55,840
will be handed over. So, so let me
 

3643
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:57,830
will be handed over. So, so let me
explain it even more accurately. There

3644
01:09:57,830 --> 01:09:57,840
explain it even more accurately. There
 

3645
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:01,030
explain it even more accurately. There
will be two stages of our interactions

3646
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:01,040
will be two stages of our interactions
 

3647
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:02,550
will be two stages of our interactions
with the machines. One is what I call

3648
01:10:02,550 --> 01:10:02,560
with the machines. One is what I call
 

3649
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:05,990
with the machines. One is what I call
the era of augmented intelligence. So,

3650
01:10:05,990 --> 01:10:06,000
the era of augmented intelligence. So,
 

3651
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,590
the era of augmented intelligence. So,
it's human intelligence augmented with

3652
01:10:07,590 --> 01:10:07,600
it's human intelligence augmented with
 

3653
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:10,390
it's human intelligence augmented with
AI doing the job. And then the following

3654
01:10:10,390 --> 01:10:10,400
AI doing the job. And then the following
 

3655
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:12,310
AI doing the job. And then the following
one is what I call the era of machine

3656
01:10:12,310 --> 01:10:12,320
one is what I call the era of machine
 

3657
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:14,470
one is what I call the era of machine
mastery. The job is done completely by

3658
01:10:14,470 --> 01:10:14,480
mastery. The job is done completely by
 

3659
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:17,510
mastery. The job is done completely by
an AI without a human in the loop. Okay.

3660
01:10:17,510 --> 01:10:17,520
an AI without a human in the loop. Okay.
 

3661
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:21,110
an AI without a human in the loop. Okay.
So in the era of augmented intelligence,

3662
01:10:21,110 --> 01:10:21,120
So in the era of augmented intelligence,
 

3663
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:23,750
So in the era of augmented intelligence,
your assistances will augment themselves

3664
01:10:23,750 --> 01:10:23,760
your assistances will augment themselves
 

3665
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:26,709
your assistances will augment themselves
with an AI to either be more productive.

3666
01:10:26,709 --> 01:10:26,719
with an AI to either be more productive.
 

3667
01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:27,189
with an AI to either be more productive.
>> Yeah.

3668
01:10:27,189 --> 01:10:27,199
>> Yeah.
 

3669
01:10:27,199 --> 01:10:31,110
>> Yeah.
>> Okay. Or interestingly to reduce the

3670
01:10:31,110 --> 01:10:31,120
>> Okay. Or interestingly to reduce the
 

3671
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:34,630
>> Okay. Or interestingly to reduce the
number of tasks that they need to do.

3672
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:34,640
number of tasks that they need to do.
 

3673
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:37,430
number of tasks that they need to do.
Correct. Now the more the number of

3674
01:10:37,430 --> 01:10:37,440
Correct. Now the more the number of
 

3675
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:39,910
Correct. Now the more the number of
tasks get reduced, the more they'll have

3676
01:10:39,910 --> 01:10:39,920
tasks get reduced, the more they'll have
 

3677
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:41,669
tasks get reduced, the more they'll have
the bandwidth and ability to do tasks

3678
01:10:41,669 --> 01:10:41,679
the bandwidth and ability to do tasks
 

3679
01:10:41,679 --> 01:10:44,229
the bandwidth and ability to do tasks
like take care of your dog, right? or

3680
01:10:44,229 --> 01:10:44,239
like take care of your dog, right? or
 

3681
01:10:44,239 --> 01:10:46,550
like take care of your dog, right? or
tasks that you know basically is about

3682
01:10:46,550 --> 01:10:46,560
tasks that you know basically is about
 

3683
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:48,630
tasks that you know basically is about
meeting your guests or whatever human

3684
01:10:48,630 --> 01:10:48,640
meeting your guests or whatever human
 

3685
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:49,189
meeting your guests or whatever human
connection.

3686
01:10:49,189 --> 01:10:49,199
connection.
 

3687
01:10:49,199 --> 01:10:50,790
connection.
>> Yeah.

3688
01:10:50,790 --> 01:10:50,800
>> Yeah.
 

3689
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:53,270
>> Yeah.
>> Life connection

3690
01:10:53,270 --> 01:10:53,280
>> Life connection
 

3691
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:56,070
>> Life connection
but do you think you need three for that

3692
01:10:56,070 --> 01:10:56,080
but do you think you need three for that
 

3693
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:58,630
but do you think you need three for that
or maybe now that some tasks have been

3694
01:10:58,630 --> 01:10:58,640
or maybe now that some tasks have been
 

3695
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:01,030
or maybe now that some tasks have been
you know outsourced to AI will you need

3696
01:11:01,030 --> 01:11:01,040
you know outsourced to AI will you need
 

3697
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:03,270
you know outsourced to AI will you need
two? You can easily calculate that from

3698
01:11:03,270 --> 01:11:03,280
two? You can easily calculate that from
 

3699
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:06,070
two? You can easily calculate that from
call center agents. So from call center

3700
01:11:06,070 --> 01:11:06,080
call center agents. So from call center
 

3701
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:09,270
call center agents. So from call center
agents they're not firing everyone but

3702
01:11:09,270 --> 01:11:09,280
agents they're not firing everyone but
 

3703
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:10,950
agents they're not firing everyone but
they're taking the first part of the

3704
01:11:10,950 --> 01:11:10,960
they're taking the first part of the
 

3705
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:13,830
they're taking the first part of the
funnel and giving it to an AI. So

3706
01:11:13,830 --> 01:11:13,840
funnel and giving it to an AI. So
 

3707
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:16,709
funnel and giving it to an AI. So
instead of having 2,000 agents in a in a

3708
01:11:16,709 --> 01:11:16,719
instead of having 2,000 agents in a in a
 

3709
01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:18,229
instead of having 2,000 agents in a in a
call center, they can now do the job

3710
01:11:18,229 --> 01:11:18,239
call center, they can now do the job
 

3711
01:11:18,239 --> 01:11:21,350
call center, they can now do the job
with 1,800. I'm just making that number

3712
01:11:21,350 --> 01:11:21,360
with 1,800. I'm just making that number
 

3713
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:24,229
with 1,800. I'm just making that number
up. H society needs to think about the

3714
01:11:24,229 --> 01:11:24,239
up. H society needs to think about the
 

3715
01:11:24,239 --> 01:11:25,189
up. H society needs to think about the
200.

3716
01:11:25,189 --> 01:11:25,199
200.
 

3717
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:26,790
200.
>> And you're telling me that they won't

3718
01:11:26,790 --> 01:11:26,800
>> And you're telling me that they won't
 

3719
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:29,030
>> And you're telling me that they won't
move into other roles somewhere else.

3720
01:11:29,030 --> 01:11:29,040
move into other roles somewhere else.
 

3721
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:30,709
move into other roles somewhere else.
>> I am telling you I don't know what those

3722
01:11:30,709 --> 01:11:30,719
>> I am telling you I don't know what those
 

3723
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:31,750
>> I am telling you I don't know what those
roles are.

3724
01:11:31,750 --> 01:11:31,760
roles are.
 

3725
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:33,430
roles are.
>> Well, I think we should all be

3726
01:11:33,430 --> 01:11:33,440
>> Well, I think we should all be
 

3727
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:35,110
>> Well, I think we should all be
musicians. We should all be authors. We

3728
01:11:35,110 --> 01:11:35,120
musicians. We should all be authors. We
 

3729
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:36,550
musicians. We should all be authors. We
should all be artists. We should all be

3730
01:11:36,550 --> 01:11:36,560
should all be artists. We should all be

01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:37,669
should all be artists. We should all be
entertainers. We should all be

01:11:37,669 --> 01:11:37,679
entertainers. We should all be
 

3733
01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:39,510
entertainers. We should all be
comedians. We should all these are roles

3734
01:11:39,510 --> 01:11:39,520
comedians. We should all these are roles
 

3735
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:41,590
comedians. We should all these are roles
that will remain.

3736
01:11:41,590 --> 01:11:41,600
that will remain.
 

3737
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:43,350
that will remain.
We should all be plumbers for the next 5

3738
01:11:43,350 --> 01:11:43,360
We should all be plumbers for the next 5
 

3739
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:46,950
We should all be plumbers for the next 5
to 10 years. Fantastic. Okay. But even

3740
01:11:46,950 --> 01:11:46,960
to 10 years. Fantastic. Okay. But even
 

3741
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:50,390
to 10 years. Fantastic. Okay. But even
that requires society to morph

3742
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:50,400
that requires society to morph
 

3743
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:53,110
that requires society to morph
and societyy's not talking about it.

3744
01:11:53,110 --> 01:11:53,120
and societyy's not talking about it.
 

3745
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:54,790
and societyy's not talking about it.
Okay. I had this wonderful interview

3746
01:11:54,790 --> 01:11:54,800
Okay. I had this wonderful interview
 

3747
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:56,709
Okay. I had this wonderful interview
with friends of mine, Peter Dendez and

3748
01:11:56,709 --> 01:11:56,719
with friends of mine, Peter Dendez and
 

3749
01:11:56,719 --> 01:11:59,590
with friends of mine, Peter Dendez and
and some of our friends and and they

01:11:59,590 --> 01:11:59,600
and some of our friends and and they
 

3751
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:01,189
and some of our friends and and they
were saying, "Oh, you know, the American

3752
01:12:01,189 --> 01:12:01,199
were saying, "Oh, you know, the American
 

3753
01:12:01,199 --> 01:12:02,870
were saying, "Oh, you know, the American

be entrepreneurs." I was like,
 

3757
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:06,709
be entrepreneurs." I was like,
seriously, you're expecting a truck

3758
01:12:06,709 --> 01:12:06,719
seriously, you're expecting a truck
 

3759
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:09,189
seriously, you're expecting a truck
driver that will be replaced by an

3760
01:12:09,189 --> 01:12:09,199
driver that will be replaced by an
 

3761
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:11,750
driver that will be replaced by an
autonomous truck to become an

3762
01:12:11,750 --> 01:12:11,760
autonomous truck to become an
 

3763
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:14,950
autonomous truck to become an
entrepreneur? Like, please put yourself

3764
01:12:14,950 --> 01:12:14,960
entrepreneur? Like, please put yourself
 

3765
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:18,149
entrepreneur? Like, please put yourself
in the shoes of real people,

in the shoes of real people,
 

3767
01:12:18,159 --> 01:12:19,910
in the shoes of real people,
right? You expect a single mother who

01:12:19,910 --> 01:12:19,920
right? You expect a single mother who
 

3769
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:24,310
right? You expect a single mother who
has three jobs

3770
01:12:24,310 --> 01:12:24,320

 

3771
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:27,990

to become an entrepreneur.

3772
01:12:27,990 --> 01:12:28,000

 

3773
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,550

And I'm not saying this is a dystopia.

3774
01:12:30,550 --> 01:12:30,560
And I'm not saying this is a dystopia.
 

3775
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:32,709
And I'm not saying this is a dystopia.
It's a dystopia if humanity manages it

3776
01:12:32,709 --> 01:12:32,719
It's a dystopia if humanity manages it
 

3777
01:12:32,719 --> 01:12:35,510
It's a dystopia if humanity manages it
badly. Why? Because this could be the

3778
01:12:35,510 --> 01:12:35,520
badly. Why? Because this could be the
 

3779
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:37,669
badly. Why? Because this could be the
utopia itself where that single mother

3780
01:12:37,669 --> 01:12:37,679
utopia itself where that single mother
 

3781
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:40,550
utopia itself where that single mother
does not need three jobs.

3782

3783
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:43,110

Okay? If we of if of our society was

01:12:43,110 --> 01:12:43,120
Okay? If we of if of our society was
 

3785
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:45,830
Okay? If we of if of our society was
just enough, that single mother should

3786
01:12:45,830 --> 01:12:45,840

have never needed three jobs,

I think no. I think a few of us will

my AIS today,

4360
01:24:05,910 --> 01:24:05,920
my AIS today,
 

4361
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:10,149
my AIS today,
I borrow around 50 to 80 IQ points. I

4362
01:24:10,149 --> 01:24:10,159
I borrow around 50 to 80 IQ points. I
 

4363
01:24:10,159 --> 01:24:11,750
I borrow around 50 to 80 IQ points. I
say that because I've worked with people

4364
01:24:11,750 --> 01:24:11,760
say that because I've worked with people
 

4365
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:13,830
say that because I've worked with people
that had 50 to 80 IQ points more than

4366
01:24:13,830 --> 01:24:13,840
that had 50 to 80 IQ points more than
 

4367
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:17,110
that had 50 to 80 IQ points more than
me. And I now can see that I can sort of

4368
01:24:17,110 --> 01:24:17,120
me. And I now can see that I can sort of
 

4369
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:20,629
me. And I now can see that I can sort of
stand my my place.

4370
01:24:20,629 --> 01:24:20,639
stand my my place.
 

4371
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:24,550
stand my my place.
50 50 IQ points, by the way, is enormous

4372
01:24:24,550 --> 01:24:24,560
50 50 IQ points, by the way, is enormous
 

4373
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:28,149
50 50 IQ points, by the way, is enormous
because IQ is exponential. So the the

4374
01:24:28,149 --> 01:24:28,159
because IQ is exponential. So the the
 

4375
01:24:28,159 --> 01:24:31,510
because IQ is exponential. So the the
last 50 are bigger than my entire IQ,

4376
01:24:31,510 --> 01:24:31,520
last 50 are bigger than my entire IQ,
 

4377
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:33,110
last 50 are bigger than my entire IQ,
right?

4378
01:24:33,110 --> 01:24:33,120
right?
 

4379
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:35,990
right?
If I borrow 50 IQ points on top of say

4380
01:24:35,990 --> 01:24:36,000
If I borrow 50 IQ points on top of say
 

4381
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:39,270
If I borrow 50 IQ points on top of say
100 that I have, that's 30%.

4382
01:24:39,270 --> 01:24:39,280
100 that I have, that's 30%.
 

4383

4,000 I end up with 4,100 another ends
up with 400 4, you know 130 really

4404
01:25:13,830 --> 01:25:13,840
up with 400 4, you know 130 really
 

4405
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:16,390
up with 400 4, you know 130 really
doesn't make much difference. Okay. And

4406
01:25:16,390 --> 01:25:16,400
doesn't make much difference. Okay. And
 

4407
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:19,189
doesn't make much difference. Okay. And
because of that the difference between

because of that the difference between

is going to be irrelevant. So all of us
 

4415
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:28,709
is going to be irrelevant. So all of us
suddenly become equal and and this also

01:25:28,709 --> 01:25:28,719
suddenly become equal and and this also
 

4417
01:25:28,719 --> 01:25:30,870

happens economically. All of us become

One of the things I'm actually really

One of the things I'm actually really

The entire conversation is what does

The entire conversation is what does
 

5227
01:39:33,679 --> 01:39:35,750
The entire conversation is what does

society have to do to get there? What
does society have to do to get there?

5230
01:39:37,350 --> 01:39:37,360
does society have to do to get there?
 

5231
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:40,149
does society have to do to get there?
>> We need to stop uh uh thinking from a

5237
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:46,790

don't have a good track record of that.

5238
01:39:46,790 --> 01:39:46,800
don't have a good track record of that.
 

5239
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:49,109
don't have a good track record of that.
>> Yeah. So this is probably the the reason

5240
01:39:49,109 --> 01:39:49,119
>> Yeah. So this is probably the the reason
 

5241
01:39:49,119 --> 01:39:52,149
>> Yeah. So this is probably the the reason
for the other half of my work which is

01:39:52,149 --> 01:39:52,159
for the other half of my work which is
 

5243
01:39:52,159 --> 01:39:54,950
for the other half of my work which is
you know I'm trying to say

5244
01:39:54,950 --> 01:39:54,960
you know I'm trying to say
 

5245
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:57,750
you know I'm trying to say
what really matters to humans.

5246
01:39:57,750 --> 01:39:57,760
what really matters to humans.
 

5247
01:39:57,760 --> 01:39:58,470
what really matters to humans.
>> What is that?

5248
01:39:58,470 --> 01:39:58,480
>> What is that?
 

5249
01:39:58,480 --> 01:40:00,950
>> What is that?
>> If you ask most humans what do they want

5250
01:40:00,950 --> 01:40:00,960
>> If you ask most humans what do they want
 

5251
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:03,830
>> If you ask most humans what do they want
more most in life? I'd say they want to

5252
01:40:03,830 --> 01:40:03,840
more most in life? I'd say they want to
 

5253
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:06,470
more most in life? I'd say they want to
love their family, raise a family. Yeah,

5254
01:40:06,470 --> 01:40:06,480
love their family, raise a family. Yeah,
 

5255
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:07,990
love their family, raise a family. Yeah,
>> love.

5256
01:40:07,990 --> 01:40:08,000
>> love.
 

5257
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,470
>> love.
That's what most humans want most. We

5258
01:40:10,470 --> 01:40:10,480
That's what most humans want most. We
 

5259
01:40:10,480 --> 01:40:12,149
That's what most humans want most. We
want to love and be loved. We want to be

5260
01:40:12,149 --> 01:40:12,159
want to love and be loved. We want to be
 

5261
01:40:12,159 --> 01:40:14,790
want to love and be loved. We want to be
happy. We want those we care about to be

5262
01:40:14,790 --> 01:40:14,800
happy. We want those we care about to be
 

5263
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:16,470
happy. We want those we care about to be
safe and happy. And we want to love to

5264
01:40:16,470 --> 01:40:16,480
safe and happy. And we want to love to
 

5265
01:40:16,480 --> 01:40:19,350
safe and happy. And we want to love to
love and be loved. I tend to believe

5266
01:40:19,350 --> 01:40:19,360
love and be loved. I tend to believe
 

5267
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:22,790
love and be loved. I tend to believe
that the only way for us to get to a

5268
01:40:22,790 --> 01:40:22,800
that the only way for us to get to a
 

5269
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:25,350
that the only way for us to get to a
better place is for the evil people at

5270
01:40:25,350 --> 01:40:25,360
better place is for the evil people at
 

5271
01:40:25,360 --> 01:40:29,350
better place is for the evil people at
the top to be replaced with AI.

5272
01:40:29,350 --> 01:40:29,360
the top to be replaced with AI.
 

5273
01:40:29,360 --> 01:40:31,189
the top to be replaced with AI.
Okay? Because they won't be replaced by

5274
01:40:31,189 --> 01:40:31,199
Okay? Because they won't be replaced by
 

5275
01:40:31,199 --> 01:40:33,669
Okay? Because they won't be replaced by
us.

5276
01:40:33,669 --> 01:40:33,679
us.
 

5277
01:40:33,679 --> 01:40:37,830
us.
And as per the second uh dilemma, they

5278
01:40:37,830 --> 01:40:37,840
And as per the second uh dilemma, they
 

5279
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:39,990
And as per the second uh dilemma, they
will have to replace themselves by AI.

5280
01:40:39,990 --> 01:40:40,000
will have to replace themselves by AI.
 

5281
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,070
will have to replace themselves by AI.
Otherwise, they lose their advantage. If

5282
01:40:42,070 --> 01:40:42,080
Otherwise, they lose their advantage. If
 

5283
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:45,590
Otherwise, they lose their advantage. If
their competitor moves to AI, if China

5284
01:40:45,590 --> 01:40:45,600
their competitor moves to AI, if China
 

5285
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:48,070
their competitor moves to AI, if China
hands over their arsenal to AI, America

5286
01:40:48,070 --> 01:40:48,080
hands over their arsenal to AI, America
 

5287
01:40:48,080 --> 01:40:50,149
hands over their arsenal to AI, America
has to hand over their arsenal to AI.

5288
01:40:50,149 --> 01:40:50,159
has to hand over their arsenal to AI.
 

5289
01:40:50,159 --> 01:40:51,350
has to hand over their arsenal to AI.
>> Interesting. So, let's play out this

5291
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:53,270

5292
01:40:53,270 --> 01:40:53,280
scenario. Okay, this is interesting to
 

5293
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:55,990
scenario. Okay, this is interesting to
me. So if we replace the leaders that

5294
01:40:55,990 --> 01:40:56,000
me. So if we replace the leaders that
 

5295
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,790
me. So if we replace the leaders that
are power hungry with AIs that have our

01:40:58,790 --> 01:40:58,800
are power hungry with AIs that have our
 

5297
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:01,350
are power hungry with AIs that have our
interests at heart, then we might have

01:41:01,350 --> 01:41:01,360

5299
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:03,350

because of what normally is referred to
 

5313
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:17,669
because of what normally is referred to
as the minimum energy principle. So, so

as the minimum energy principle. So, so

>> Okay. Of course, if you know before we
hand over to them and before they're

5632
01:47:19,109 --> 01:47:19,119
hand over to them and before they're
 

5633
01:47:19,119 --> 01:47:21,590
hand over to them and before they're
intelligent enough to make you know

5634
01:47:21,590 --> 01:47:21,600
intelligent enough to make you know
 

5635
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:23,990
intelligent enough to make you know
autonomous decisions, we we tell them

5636
01:47:23,990 --> 01:47:24,000
autonomous decisions, we we tell them
 

5637
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,229
autonomous decisions, we we tell them
no, the task is to reduce humanity from

5638
01:47:26,229 --> 01:47:26,239
no, the task is to reduce humanity from
 

5639
01:47:26,239 --> 01:47:29,590
no, the task is to reduce humanity from
7 billion people to one.

5640
01:47:29,590 --> 01:47:29,600
7 billion people to one.
 

5641
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:31,750
7 billion people to one.
I think even then eventually they'll go

5642
01:47:31,750 --> 01:47:31,760
I think even then eventually they'll go
 

5643
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:33,510
I think even then eventually they'll go
like that's the wrong objective. Every

5644
01:47:33,510 --> 01:47:33,520
like that's the wrong objective. Every
 

5645
01:47:33,520 --> 01:47:35,830
like that's the wrong objective. Every
any smart person that you speak to will

5646
01:47:35,830 --> 01:47:35,840
any smart person that you speak to will
 

5647
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:37,430
any smart person that you speak to will
say that's the wrong objective. I think

5648
01:47:37,430 --> 01:47:37,440
say that's the wrong objective. I think
 

5649
01:47:37,440 --> 01:47:39,910
say that's the wrong objective. I think
if we look at the directive that Xi

5650
01:47:39,910 --> 01:47:39,920
if we look at the directive that Xi
 

5651
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:42,870
if we look at the directive that Xi
Jinping, the leader of China has and

5652
01:47:42,870 --> 01:47:42,880
Jinping, the leader of China has and
 

5653
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:44,390
Jinping, the leader of China has and
Donald Trump has as the leader of

5654
01:47:44,390 --> 01:47:44,400
Donald Trump has as the leader of
 

5655
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:46,470
Donald Trump has as the leader of
America, I think they would say that

5656
01:47:46,470 --> 01:47:46,480
America, I think they would say that
 

5657
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:48,950
America, I think they would say that
their stated objective is prosperity for

5658
01:47:48,950 --> 01:47:48,960
their stated objective is prosperity for
 

5659
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:51,430
their stated objective is prosperity for
their country. So if we that's what they

5660
01:47:51,430 --> 01:47:51,440
their country. So if we that's what they
 

5661
01:47:51,440 --> 01:47:52,229
their country. So if we that's what they
would say, right?

5662
01:47:52,229 --> 01:47:52,239
would say, right?
 

5663
01:47:52,239 --> 01:47:54,950
would say, right?
>> Yeah. And one one of them means it.

5664
01:47:54,950 --> 01:47:54,960
>> Yeah. And one one of them means it.
 

5665
01:47:54,960 --> 01:47:57,030
>> Yeah. And one one of them means it.
>> Okay, we'll get into that. But they'll

5666
01:47:57,030 --> 01:47:57,040
>> Okay, we'll get into that. But they'll
 

5667
01:47:57,040 --> 01:47:58,629
>> Okay, we'll get into that. But they'll
say that that it's prosperity for their

5668
01:47:58,629 --> 01:47:58,639
say that that it's prosperity for their
 

5669
01:47:58,639 --> 01:48:00,550
say that that it's prosperity for their
country. So one would then assume that

5670
01:48:00,550 --> 01:48:00,560
country. So one would then assume that
 

5671
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:02,550
country. So one would then assume that
when we move to an AI leader, the

5672
01:48:02,550 --> 01:48:02,560
when we move to an AI leader, the
 

5673
01:48:02,560 --> 01:48:03,590
when we move to an AI leader, the
objective would be the same. The

5674
01:48:03,590 --> 01:48:03,600
objective would be the same. The
 

5675
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:05,350
objective would be the same. The
directive would be the same. make our

5676
01:48:05,350 --> 01:48:05,360
directive would be the same. make our
 

5677
01:48:05,360 --> 01:48:06,709
directive would be the same. make our
country prosperous.

5678
01:48:06,709 --> 01:48:06,719
country prosperous.
 

5679
01:48:06,719 --> 01:48:07,510
country prosperous.
>> Corre. Correct.

5680
01:48:07,510 --> 01:48:07,520
>> Corre. Correct.
 

5681
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:08,790
>> Corre. Correct.
>> And I think that's the AI that people

5682
01:48:08,790 --> 01:48:08,800
>> And I think that's the AI that people
 

5683
01:48:08,800 --> 01:48:10,310
>> And I think that's the AI that people
would vote for potentially. I think they

5684
01:48:10,310 --> 01:48:10,320
would vote for potentially. I think they
 

5685
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:11,430
would vote for potentially. I think they
would say we want to be prosperous.

5686
01:48:11,430 --> 01:48:11,440
would say we want to be prosperous.
 

5687
01:48:11,440 --> 01:48:12,790
would say we want to be prosperous.
>> What do you think would make America

5688
01:48:12,790 --> 01:48:12,800
>> What do you think would make America
 

5689
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:14,950
>> What do you think would make America
more prosperous?

5690
01:48:14,950 --> 01:48:14,960
more prosperous?
 

5691
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:17,109
more prosperous?
>> To spend a trillion dollars on on war

helping the poor and homelessness.
 

5701
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:31,510
helping the poor and homelessness.
It's complex because I think so I think

5702
01:48:31,510 --> 01:48:31,520
It's complex because I think so I think
 

5703
01:48:31,520 --> 01:48:33,830
It's complex because I think so I think
it would make America more prosperous to

01:48:33,830 --> 01:48:33,840
it would make America more prosperous to
 

5705
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:36,310
it would make America more prosperous to

the of everybody and they have the
 

5709
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:41,910
the of everybody and they have the
luxury of doing that because they are

01:48:41,910 --> 01:48:41,920
luxury of doing that because they are
 

5711
01:48:41,920 --> 01:48:42,709
luxury of doing that because they are

>> the most powerful

01:48:43,990 --> 01:48:44,000
>> the most powerful nation in the world.
 

5715
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:45,990
>> the most powerful nation in the world.
>> No, that's not true. The the the reason

5716
01:48:45,990 --> 01:48:46,000
>> No, that's not true. The the the reason
 

5717
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:49,109
>> No, that's not true. The the the reason
so so you see all war has two

5718
01:48:49,109 --> 01:48:49,119
so so you see all war has two
 

5719
01:48:49,119 --> 01:48:51,750
so so you see all war has two
objectives. One is to make money for the

5720
01:48:51,750 --> 01:48:51,760
objectives. One is to make money for the
 

5721
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:55,109
objectives. One is to make money for the
war machine and the other is deterrence.

5722
01:48:55,109 --> 01:48:55,119
war machine and the other is deterrence.
 

5723
01:48:55,119 --> 01:48:58,790
war machine and the other is deterrence.
Okay. and nine super nuclear powers

5724
01:48:58,790 --> 01:48:58,800
Okay. and nine super nuclear powers
 

5725
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:02,070
Okay. and nine super nuclear powers
around the world is enough deterrence.

5726
01:49:02,070 --> 01:49:02,080
around the world is enough deterrence.
 

5727
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:04,229
around the world is enough deterrence.
So any

5728
01:49:04,229 --> 01:49:04,239
So any
 

5729
01:49:04,239 --> 01:49:07,109
So any
war between America and China will go

5730
01:49:07,109 --> 01:49:07,119
war between America and China will go
 

5731
01:49:07,119 --> 01:49:10,550
war between America and China will go
through a long phase of destroying

5732
01:49:10,550 --> 01:49:10,560
through a long phase of destroying
 

5733
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:14,390
through a long phase of destroying
wealth by exploding bombs and killing

5734
01:49:14,390 --> 01:49:14,400
wealth by exploding bombs and killing
 

5735
01:49:14,400 --> 01:49:17,109
wealth by exploding bombs and killing
humans for the first objective to

5736
01:49:17,109 --> 01:49:17,119
humans for the first objective to
 

5737
01:49:17,119 --> 01:49:19,910
humans for the first objective to
happen. Okay? And then eventually if it

5738
01:49:19,910 --> 01:49:19,920
happen. Okay? And then eventually if it
 

5739
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:21,910
happen. Okay? And then eventually if it
really comes to deterrence it's the

5740
01:49:21,910 --> 01:49:21,920
really comes to deterrence it's the
 

5741
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:24,629
really comes to deterrence it's the
nuclear bombs or now in the age of AI

5742
01:49:24,629 --> 01:49:24,639
nuclear bombs or now in the age of AI
 

5743
01:49:24,639 --> 01:49:27,669
nuclear bombs or now in the age of AI
biological uh you know manufactured

5744
01:49:27,669 --> 01:49:27,679
biological uh you know manufactured
 

5745
01:49:27,679 --> 01:49:31,189
biological uh you know manufactured
viruses or whatever uh these super

5746
01:49:31,189 --> 01:49:31,199
viruses or whatever uh these super
 

5747
01:49:31,199 --> 01:49:34,070
viruses or whatever uh these super
weapons this is the only thing that you

5748
01:49:34,070 --> 01:49:34,080
weapons this is the only thing that you
 

5749
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:35,830
weapons this is the only thing that you
need

5750
01:49:35,830 --> 01:49:35,840
need
 

5751
01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:38,390
need
so for China to have nuclear bombs not

5752
01:49:38,390 --> 01:49:38,400
so for China to have nuclear bombs not
 

5753
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:41,510
so for China to have nuclear bombs not
as many as the US is enough for China to

5754
01:49:41,510 --> 01:49:41,520
as many as the US is enough for China to
 

5755
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:44,550
as many as the US is enough for China to
say don't f with me

5756
01:49:44,550 --> 01:49:44,560
say don't f with me
 

5757
01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:48,790
say don't f with me
and this seems I do not know I'm not in

5758
01:49:48,790 --> 01:49:48,800
and this seems I do not know I'm not in
 

5759
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:52,070
and this seems I do not know I'm not in
in in PresidentQi's mind. I I'm not in

5760
01:49:52,070 --> 01:49:52,080
in in PresidentQi's mind. I I'm not in
 

5761
01:49:52,080 --> 01:49:53,990
in in PresidentQi's mind. I I'm not in
President Trump's mind. I you know, it's

5762
01:49:53,990 --> 01:49:54,000
President Trump's mind. I you know, it's
 

5763
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:55,990
President Trump's mind. I you know, it's
very difficult to to navigate what he's

5764
01:49:55,990 --> 01:49:56,000
very difficult to to navigate what he's
 

5765
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,550
very difficult to to navigate what he's
thinking about. But the truth is that

5766
01:49:58,550 --> 01:49:58,560
thinking about. But the truth is that
 

5767
01:49:58,560 --> 01:50:01,830
thinking about. But the truth is that
the Chinese line is for the last 30

5768
01:50:01,830 --> 01:50:01,840
the Chinese line is for the last 30
 

5769
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:04,709
the Chinese line is for the last 30
years you spent so much on war while we

5770
01:50:04,709 --> 01:50:04,719
years you spent so much on war while we
 

5771
01:50:04,719 --> 01:50:06,870
years you spent so much on war while we
spent on industrial infrastructure. And

5772
01:50:06,870 --> 01:50:06,880
spent on industrial infrastructure. And
 

5773
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:09,910
spent on industrial infrastructure. And
that's the reason we are now by far the

5774
01:50:09,910 --> 01:50:09,920
that's the reason we are now by far the
 

5775
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:11,590
that's the reason we are now by far the
largest nation on the planet. Even

5776
01:50:11,590 --> 01:50:11,600
largest nation on the planet. Even
 

5777
01:50:11,600 --> 01:50:12,950
largest nation on the planet. Even
though the west will lie and say

5778
01:50:12,950 --> 01:50:12,960
though the west will lie and say
 

5779
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:14,470
though the west will lie and say
America's bigger, America's bigger in

5780
01:50:14,470 --> 01:50:14,480
America's bigger, America's bigger in
 

5781
01:50:14,480 --> 01:50:16,709
America's bigger, America's bigger in
dollars, okay, with purchasing power

5782
01:50:16,709 --> 01:50:16,719
dollars, okay, with purchasing power
 

5783
01:50:16,719 --> 01:50:20,550
dollars, okay, with purchasing power
parity, this is very equivalent.

5784
01:50:20,550 --> 01:50:20,560
parity, this is very equivalent.
 

5785
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:22,550
parity, this is very equivalent.
Okay. Now, when you really understand

5786
01:50:22,550 --> 01:50:22,560
Okay. Now, when you really understand
 

5787
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:25,910
Okay. Now, when you really understand
that, you understand that prosperity is

5788
01:50:25,910 --> 01:50:25,920

01:56:15,440 --> 01:56:18,470
Nefertiti and then another life where
you're a donkey right reincarnation

6108
01:56:18,470 --> 01:56:18,480
you're a donkey right reincarnation
 

6109
01:56:18,480 --> 01:56:21,270
you're a donkey right reincarnation
truly in the virtual world

6110
01:56:21,270 --> 01:56:21,280
truly in the virtual world
 

6111
01:56:21,280 --> 01:56:23,669
truly in the virtual world
and then you know I get another life

6112
01:56:23,669 --> 01:56:23,679
and then you know I get another life
 

6113
01:56:23,679 --> 01:56:26,229
and then you know I get another life
when I date Hannah again and I you know

6114
01:56:26,229 --> 01:56:26,239
when I date Hannah again and I you know
 

6115
01:56:26,239 --> 01:56:28,629
when I date Hannah again and I you know
enjoy that life tremendously and

6116
01:56:28,629 --> 01:56:28,639
enjoy that life tremendously and
 

6117
01:56:28,639 --> 01:56:31,430
enjoy that life tremendously and
basically the cost of all of this is

6118
01:56:31,430 --> 01:56:31,440
basically the cost of all of this is
 

6119
01:56:31,440 --> 01:56:34,229
basically the cost of all of this is
zero. You wake up for one hour, you walk

6120
01:56:34,229 --> 01:56:34,239
zero. You wake up for one hour, you walk
 

6121
01:56:34,239 --> 01:56:37,350
zero. You wake up for one hour, you walk
around, you move your blood, you eat

6122
01:56:37,350 --> 01:56:37,360
around, you move your blood, you eat
 

6123
01:56:37,360 --> 01:56:39,189
around, you move your blood, you eat
something or you don't, and then you put

6124
01:56:39,189 --> 01:56:39,199
something or you don't, and then you put
 

6125
01:56:39,199 --> 01:56:41,430
something or you don't, and then you put
the headset again and live again. Is

6126
01:56:41,430 --> 01:56:41,440
the headset again and live again. Is
 

6127
01:56:41,440 --> 01:56:45,910
the headset again and live again. Is
that unthinkable?

6128
01:56:45,910 --> 01:56:45,920

 

6129
01:56:45,920 --> 01:56:48,390

Okay.
Now, now ask yourself if we can create

that in the virtual world,
 

6153

think of the uncertainty principle of
 

6175
01:57:35,599 --> 01:57:38,709
think of the uncertainty principle of
quantum physics, right? What you what

6176
01:57:38,709 --> 01:57:38,719
quantum physics, right? What you what
 

6177
01:57:38,719 --> 01:57:41,510
quantum physics, right? What you what
you what you observe gets collapses the

you what you observe gets collapses the
 

6179
01:57:41,520 --> 01:57:43,430
you what you observe gets collapses the
wave function and gets rendered into

6180
01:57:43,430 --> 01:57:43,440
wave function and gets rendered into
 

6181
01:57:43,440 --> 01:57:45,109
wave function and gets rendered into
reality. Correct.

6182
01:57:45,109 --> 01:57:45,119
reality. Correct.
 

6183
01:57:45,119 --> 01:57:46,550

>> I don't know anything about physics. So
 

6185
01:57:46,560 --> 01:57:46,950

you
 

6187
01:57:46,960 --> 01:57:48,709
you
>> so so quantum physics basically tells

superposition.
 

6193
01:57:52,239 --> 01:57:55,830

Right? So ev every subatomic particle

6194
01:57:55,830 --> 01:57:55,840
Right? So ev every subatomic particle
 

6195
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:57,750
Right? So ev every subatomic particle
that ever existed has the chance to

6196
01:57:57,750 --> 01:57:57,760
that ever existed has the chance to
 

6197
01:57:57,760 --> 01:58:00,070
that ever existed has the chance to
exist anywhere at any point in time and

6198
01:58:00,070 --> 01:58:00,080
exist anywhere at any point in time and
 

6199
01:58:00,080 --> 01:58:02,149
exist anywhere at any point in time and
then when it's observed by an observer

6200
01:58:02,149 --> 01:58:02,159
then when it's observed by an observer
 

6201
01:58:02,159 --> 01:58:06,310
then when it's observed by an observer
it collapses and becomes that. Okay. In

6202
01:58:06,310 --> 01:58:06,320
it collapses and becomes that. Okay. In
 

6203
01:58:06,320 --> 01:58:08,149
it collapses and becomes that. Okay. In
very interesting principle exactly how

01:58:18,629 --> 01:58:18,639
right. That part of the game world is
 

6213
01:58:18,639 --> 01:58:19,990
right. That part of the game world is
rendered. The rest is in superp

the consciousness invests in the
 

6413
02:02:00,480 --> 02:02:02,470
the consciousness invests in the
consciousness, not the avatar. Because

6414

to start uh not regulating AI but
 

7211
02:18:20,800 --> 02:18:22,870
to start uh not regulating AI but
regulating the use of AI. Was it the

so so my my example is very

7228
02:18:40,549 --> 02:18:40,559
so so my my example is very
 

7229
02:18:40,559 --> 02:18:41,990
so so my my example is very
straightforward. go to governments and

7230
02:18:41,990 --> 02:18:42,000
straightforward. go to governments and
 

7231
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:43,990
straightforward. go to governments and
say you cannot regulate the design of a

say you cannot regulate the design of a
 

7233
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:45,990
say you cannot regulate the design of a
hammer so that it can drive nails but

7234

hammer so that it can drive nails but
 

7235
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,150
hammer so that it can drive nails but
not kill a human but you can criminalize

7236

not kill a human but you can criminalize
 

7237
02:18:48,160 --> 02:18:50,309
not kill a human but you can criminalize
the killing of a human by a hammer. So

7238
02:18:50,309 --> 02:18:50,319
the killing of a human by a hammer. So
 

7239
02:18:50,319 --> 02:18:51,270
the killing of a human by a hammer. So

worse.

7834
02:29:26,469 --> 02:29:26,479
worse.
 

7835
02:29:26,479 --> 02:29:28,469
worse.
>> So, one of my favorite exercises, what I

7836
02:29:28,469 --> 02:29:28,479
>> So, one of my favorite exercises, what I
 

7837
02:29:28,479 --> 02:29:30,469
>> So, one of my favorite exercises, what I
call meet Becky, that makes my brain

7838
02:29:30,469 --> 02:29:30,479
call meet Becky, that makes my brain
 

7839
02:29:30,479 --> 02:29:33,030
call meet Becky, that makes my brain
better. So, while meditation always

7840
02:29:33,030 --> 02:29:33,040
better. So, while meditation always
 

7841
02:29:33,040 --> 02:29:34,870
better. So, while meditation always
tells you to try and calm your brain

7842
02:29:34,870 --> 02:29:34,880
tells you to try and calm your brain
 

7843
02:29:34,880 --> 02:29:37,990
tells you to try and calm your brain
down and keep it within parameters of I

7844
02:29:37,990 --> 02:29:38,000
down and keep it within parameters of I
 

7845
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,309
down and keep it within parameters of I
can focus on my breathing and so on,

7846
02:29:40,309 --> 02:29:40,319
can focus on my breathing and so on,
 

7847
02:29:40,319 --> 02:29:42,550
can focus on my breathing and so on,
meet me Becky is the opposite. You know,

7848
02:29:42,550 --> 02:29:42,560
meet me Becky is the opposite. You know,
 

7849
02:29:42,560 --> 02:29:44,230
meet me Becky is the opposite. You know,
I call my brain Becky. A lot of people

7850
02:29:44,230 --> 02:29:44,240
I call my brain Becky. A lot of people
 

7851
02:29:44,240 --> 02:29:46,550
I call my brain Becky. A lot of people
know that. So, so me meet Becky is to

7852
02:29:46,550 --> 02:29:46,560
know that. So, so me meet Becky is to
 

7853
02:29:46,560 --> 02:29:48,230
know that. So, so me meet Becky is to
actually let my brain go loose and

7854
02:29:48,230 --> 02:29:48,240
actually let my brain go loose and
 

7855
02:29:48,240 --> 02:29:51,190
actually let my brain go loose and
capture every thought. So I normally

7856
02:29:51,190 --> 02:29:51,200
capture every thought. So I normally
 

7857
02:29:51,200 --> 02:29:52,870
capture every thought. So I normally
would try to do that every couple of

7858
02:29:52,870 --> 02:29:52,880
would try to do that every couple of
 

7859
02:29:52,880 --> 02:29:55,429
would try to do that every couple of
weeks or so and then what happens is it

7860
02:29:55,429 --> 02:29:55,439
weeks or so and then what happens is it
 

7861
02:29:55,439 --> 02:29:58,469
weeks or so and then what happens is it
suddenly is on a paper and when it's on

7862
02:29:58,469 --> 02:29:58,479
suddenly is on a paper and when it's on
 

7863
02:29:58,479 --> 02:30:00,150
suddenly is on a paper and when it's on
paper you just suddenly look at it and

7864
02:30:00,150 --> 02:30:00,160
paper you just suddenly look at it and
 

7865
02:30:00,160 --> 02:30:01,750
paper you just suddenly look at it and
say oh my god that's so stupid and you

7866
02:30:01,750 --> 02:30:01,760
say oh my god that's so stupid and you
 

7867
02:30:01,760 --> 02:30:02,870
say oh my god that's so stupid and you
scratch it out

7868
02:30:02,870 --> 02:30:02,880
scratch it out
 

7869
02:30:02,880 --> 02:30:04,870
scratch it out
>> right or oh my god this needs action and

7870
02:30:04,870 --> 02:30:04,880
>> right or oh my god this needs action and
 

7871
02:30:04,880 --> 02:30:07,670
>> right or oh my god this needs action and
you actually plan something and and it's

7872
02:30:07,670 --> 02:30:07,680
you actually plan something and and it's
 

7873
02:30:07,680 --> 02:30:09,750
you actually plan something and and it's
quite interesting that the more you

7874
02:30:09,750 --> 02:30:09,760
quite interesting that the more you
 

7875
02:30:09,760 --> 02:30:11,750
quite interesting that the more you
allow your brain to give you thoughts

7876
02:30:11,750 --> 02:30:11,760
allow your brain to give you thoughts
 

7877
02:30:11,760 --> 02:30:14,150
allow your brain to give you thoughts
and you listen. So the two rules is you

7878
02:30:14,150 --> 02:30:14,160
and you listen. So the two rules is you
 

7879
02:30:14,160 --> 02:30:15,670
and you listen. So the two rules is you
acknowledge every thought and you never

7880
02:30:15,670 --> 02:30:15,680
acknowledge every thought and you never
 

7881
02:30:15,680 --> 02:30:16,790
acknowledge every thought and you never
repeat one.

7882
02:30:16,790 --> 02:30:16,800
repeat one.
 

7883
02:30:16,800 --> 02:30:19,750
repeat one.
>> Okay. So the more you listen and and

7884
02:30:19,750 --> 02:30:19,760
>> Okay. So the more you listen and and
 

7885
02:30:19,760 --> 02:30:21,910
>> Okay. So the more you listen and and
say, "Okay, I heard you." You know, you

7886
02:30:21,910 --> 02:30:21,920
say, "Okay, I heard you." You know, you
 

7887
02:30:21,920 --> 02:30:24,150
say, "Okay, I heard you." You know, you
think I'm fat. What else? And you know,

7888
02:30:24,150 --> 02:30:24,160
think I'm fat. What else? And you know,
 

7889
02:30:24,160 --> 02:30:26,150
think I'm fat. What else? And you know,
eventually your brain starts to slow

7890
02:30:26,150 --> 02:30:26,160
eventually your brain starts to slow
 

7891
02:30:26,160 --> 02:30:27,750
eventually your brain starts to slow
down and then eventually starts to

7892
02:30:27,750 --> 02:30:27,760
down and then eventually starts to
 

7893
02:30:27,760 --> 02:30:30,389
down and then eventually starts to
repeat thoughts and then it goes into

7894
02:30:30,389 --> 02:30:30,399
repeat thoughts and then it goes into
 

7895
02:30:30,399 --> 02:30:33,990
repeat thoughts and then it goes into
total silence. Beautiful practice. I uh

7896
02:30:33,990 --> 02:30:34,000
total silence. Beautiful practice. I uh
 

7897
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,870
total silence. Beautiful practice. I uh
I don't trust my brain anymore. So

7898
02:30:36,870 --> 02:30:36,880
I don't trust my brain anymore. So
 

7899
02:30:36,880 --> 02:30:38,150
I don't trust my brain anymore. So
that's actually a really interesting

7900
02:30:38,150 --> 02:30:38,160
that's actually a really interesting
 

7901
02:30:38,160 --> 02:30:39,990
that's actually a really interesting
practice. So I debate a lot of what my

7902
02:30:39,990 --> 02:30:40,000
practice. So I debate a lot of what my
 

7903
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:41,750
practice. So I debate a lot of what my
brain tells me. I debate what my

7904
02:30:41,750 --> 02:30:41,760
brain tells me. I debate what my
 

7905
02:30:41,760 --> 02:30:44,630
brain tells me. I debate what my
tendencies and ideologies are. Okay. I

7906
02:30:44,630 --> 02:30:44,640
tendencies and ideologies are. Okay. I
 

7907
02:30:44,640 --> 02:30:48,309
tendencies and ideologies are. Okay. I
think one of the most uh again in in my

7908
02:30:48,309 --> 02:30:48,319
think one of the most uh again in in my
 

7909
02:30:48,319 --> 02:30:51,429
think one of the most uh again in in my
uh love story with Hannah, I get to

7910
02:30:51,429 --> 02:30:51,439
uh love story with Hannah, I get to
 

7911
02:30:51,439 --> 02:30:54,070
uh love story with Hannah, I get to
question a lot of what I believed was

7912
02:30:54,070 --> 02:30:54,080
question a lot of what I believed was
 

7913
02:30:54,080 --> 02:30:58,070
question a lot of what I believed was
who I am even at this age. Okay. And and

7914
02:30:58,070 --> 02:30:58,080
who I am even at this age. Okay. And and
 

7915
02:30:58,080 --> 02:31:00,070
who I am even at this age. Okay. And and
that goes really deep and it really is

7916
02:31:00,070 --> 02:31:00,080
that goes really deep and it really is
 

7917
02:31:00,080 --> 02:31:03,110
that goes really deep and it really is
quite a it's it's quite interesting to

7918
02:31:03,110 --> 02:31:03,120
quite a it's it's quite interesting to
 

7919
02:31:03,120 --> 02:31:05,990
quite a it's it's quite interesting to
debate not object but debate what your

7920
02:31:05,990 --> 02:31:06,000
debate not object but debate what your
 

7921
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,469
debate not object but debate what your
mind believes. I think that's very very

7922
02:31:08,469 --> 02:31:08,479
mind believes. I think that's very very
 

7923
02:31:08,479 --> 02:31:11,270
mind believes. I think that's very very
useful. And the third is I've actually

7924
02:31:11,270 --> 02:31:11,280
useful. And the third is I've actually
 

7925
02:31:11,280 --> 02:31:13,349
useful. And the third is I've actually
quadrupled my investment time. So I used

7926
02:31:13,349 --> 02:31:13,359
quadrupled my investment time. So I used
 

7927
02:31:13,359 --> 02:31:15,030
quadrupled my investment time. So I used
to do an hour a day of reading when I

7928
02:31:15,030 --> 02:31:15,040
to do an hour a day of reading when I
 

7929
02:31:15,040 --> 02:31:16,950
to do an hour a day of reading when I
was younger every single day like going

7930
02:31:16,950 --> 02:31:16,960
was younger every single day like going
 

7931
02:31:16,960 --> 02:31:19,429
was younger every single day like going
to the gym. And then it became an hour

7932
02:31:19,429 --> 02:31:19,439
to the gym. And then it became an hour
 

7933
02:31:19,439 --> 02:31:21,030
to the gym. And then it became an hour
and a half, two hours. Now I do four

7934
02:31:21,030 --> 02:31:21,040
and a half, two hours. Now I do four
 

7935
02:31:21,040 --> 02:31:22,790
and a half, two hours. Now I do four
hours a day.

7936
02:31:22,790 --> 02:31:22,800
hours a day.
 

7937
02:31:22,800 --> 02:31:25,110
hours a day.
>> Four hours a day. It is impossible to

7938
02:31:25,110 --> 02:31:25,120
>> Four hours a day. It is impossible to
 

7939
02:31:25,120 --> 02:31:28,309
>> Four hours a day. It is impossible to
keep up. The world is moving so fast.

7940
02:31:28,309 --> 02:31:28,319
keep up. The world is moving so fast.
 

7941
02:31:28,319 --> 02:31:31,190
keep up. The world is moving so fast.
>> And so that these are uh these are the

7942
02:31:31,190 --> 02:31:31,200
>> And so that these are uh these are the
 

7943
02:31:31,200 --> 02:31:32,950
>> And so that these are uh these are the
good things that I do. The bad things is

7944
02:31:32,950 --> 02:31:32,960
good things that I do. The bad things is
 

7945
02:31:32,960 --> 02:31:37,030
good things that I do. The bad things is
I don't give it enough time to to really

7946
02:31:37,030 --> 02:31:37,040
I don't give it enough time to to really
 

7947
02:31:37,040 --> 02:31:39,670
I don't give it enough time to to really
uh slow down. Uh unfortunately I'm

7948
02:31:39,670 --> 02:31:39,680
uh slow down. Uh unfortunately I'm
 

7949
02:31:39,680 --> 02:31:41,270

02:31:44,150 --> 02:31:44,160
constantly traveling. I have picked up a
 

7953
02:31:44,160 --> 02:31:46,469
constantly traveling. I have picked up a
bad habit because of the 4 hours a day

7954
02:31:46,469 --> 02:31:46,479
bad habit because of the 4 hours a day
 

7955
02:31:46,479 --> 02:31:48,469
bad habit because of the 4 hours a day
of spending more time on screens. That's

7956
02:31:48,469 --> 02:31:48,479
of spending more time on screens. That's
 

7957
02:31:48,479 --> 02:31:52,150
of spending more time on screens. That's
really really bad for my brain and I uh

really really bad for my brain and I uh
 

7959
